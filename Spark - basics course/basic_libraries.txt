THE FOUR LIBRARIES ARE:
- SPARK SQL (SQL, HIVE QL, SCALA QUERIES): SCHEMARDD CAN BE CREATED USING EXISTING RDD'S, A PARQUET FILE, A JSON DATASET OR HIVEQL; SQLCONTEXT CREATED FROM SPARKCONTEXT (CAN BE DONE USING REFLECTION WHEN SCHEMA OF DATABASE IS KNOWN OR USING AN INTERFACE TO CONSTRUCT A SCHEMA)
- SPARK STREAMING: PROCESS LIVE STREAMING DATA INTO SMALL BATCHES (SCALABLE, HIGH-THROUGHPUT, FAULT-TOLERANT); DSTREAMS ARE STREAMING PROGRAMS WHICH CREATE RDD'S FROM A STREAM OF DATA; ACCEPTS INPUT FROM KAFKA, FLUME, HDFS, KINESIS, TEXT DATA TYPES OR TWITTER; INPUT COMES INTO SPARK STREAMING, DATA IS BROKEN UP INTO BATCHES AND GIVEN TO SPARK ENGINE WHICH SENDS IT OUT IN STREAMS OF BATCHES AFTER PROCESSING; SUPPORT SLIDING WINDOW OPERATIONS (WINDOW LENGTH/DURATION, SLIDING INTERVAL/INTERVAL TO PERFORM WINDOW OPERATION)
- GRAPHX: GRAPH DATA PROCESSING, SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKS OR LANGUAGE MODELING; VIEW DATA BOTH AS COLLECTIONS/RDDS AND AS GRAPHS, WITHOUT DUPLICATION OR DATA MOVEMENT
- MLLIB: CLASSIFICATION, CLUSTERING, FILTERING, DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
