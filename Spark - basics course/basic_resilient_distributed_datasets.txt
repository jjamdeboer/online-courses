RESILIENT DISTRIBUTED DATASET CAN BE WORKED ON IN PARALLEL AND ARE IMMUTABLE
DIRECTED ACYCLICAL GRAPHS ARE CREATED TO CREATE OPERATIONS, BUT THESE ARE LAZILY EVALUATED

RDD ARE CREATED EITHER BY:
- PARALLELLIZING EXISTING COLLECTIONS
- REFERENCING A DATASET (DATASETS FROM ANY STORAGE SUPPORTED BY HADOOP)
- TRANSFORMATION OF EXISTING RDD

DATASETS FROM ANY STORAGE SUPPORTED BY HADOOP
TYPES OF FILES SUPPORTED: TEXT FILES, SEQUENCEFILES, HADOOP INPUTFORMAT

TWO TYPES OF OPERATIONS: TRANSFORMATIONS AND ACTIONS
TRANSFORMATION RETURN POINTERS TO THE RDD CREATED AND ACTIONS RETURN RDD

FUNCTIONS ARE BASICALLY STORED AS NESTED FUNCTIONS IN A DAG AND NOT CALLED UNTIL NECESSARY

RDD PERSISTENCE IS CACHING BY DEFAULT, PERSISTENCE GIVES OPTIONS ON WHAT TO DO WITH THE RESULTS OF ACTIONS/TRANSFORMATIONS

SPARK PROVIDES TWO SHARED VARIABLE TYPES: BROADCAST VARIABLES (READ-ONLY COPY ON EACH MACHINE) AND ACCUMULATORS (ADDED THROUGH ASSOCIATIVE OPERATIONS; ONLY DRIVER CAN READ ACCUMULATOR TYPES)
SPARK ALSO SUPPORTS KEY-VALUE-PAIRS
