THREE MAIN COMPONENTS OF SPARK CLUSTER: DRIVER WHERE SPARKCONTEXT IS LOCATED WITHIN MAIN PROGRAM; CLUSTER MANAGER (BUILT-IN OR YARN OR MESOS); WORKER NODES WITH EXECUTERS (PROCESSES THAT RUN THE COMPUTATIONS AND STORE THE DATA), EACH APPLICATION GETS ITS OWN EXECUTER AND THE EXECUTOR STAYS THERE FOR DURATION OF THE APPLICATION, WHICH MEANS THAT ONE CANNOT SHARE DATA AMONG APPLICATIONS
DRIVER SENDS APPLICATION TO WORKERS AND THEN SENDS TASK TO WORKER TO DO

SPARK CONFIGURATION LOCATED AT THREE POINTS:
- SPARK PROPERTIES: APPLICATION PARAMETERS CAN BE SET USING SPARKCONF-OBJECT (CREATING THE SPARKCONTEXT-OBJECT)
- ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: PER MACHINE SETTINGS
- LOGGING PROPERTIES: log4j.properties-FILE

THREE WAYS OF MONITORING SPARK APPLICATIONS:
- WEB UI
- METRICS
- EXTERNAL SOURCES, E.G.: GANGALIA (OVERALL CLUSTER UTILIZATION AND RESOURCE BOTTLENECKS)

DATA SERIALIZATION AND MEMORY TUNING (AMOUNT OF MEMORY TAKEN BY OBJECTS; COST OF ACCESSING THIS DATA; OVERHEAD GARBAGE COLLECTOR) WILL IMPROVE PERFORMANCE DUE TO IN-MEMORY COMPUTATIONS
