NETWORK SERVICES ARE ALSO CALLED SERVICES OR DAEMONS, THESE LISTEN ON NETWORK PORTS (PORTS WITH NUMBER < 1024 ARE PRIVILAGED PORTS, THIS SINCE ONLY ROOT CAN ACCESS THEM)
DAEMONS ARE CONSTANTLY RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND AND ARE FOCAL POINTS FOR ATTACKS ON A SYSTEM
OUTPUT, SINCE NOT CONNECTED TO A TERMINAL, OF A DAEMON IS OFTEN PUT INTO LOG FILES
THESE DAEMONS HAVE ONE TASK: SSH-PORT ONLY MONITORS INCOMING SSH-REQUESTS
IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO USE A DEDICATED USER/ACCOUNT FOR EVERY SERVICE
AVOID UNUSED AND UNSECURED SERVICES, SPECIFY THE ADDRESSES THAT SPECIFIC SERVICES/PORTS SHOULD LISTEN TO, IGNORE THE OTHERS (USING TCP WRAPPERS OR BY CONFIGURING THE FIREWALL)
AVOID USING INFORMATION LEAKAGE (SERVER REVEALING ITS NAME AND OPERATING SYSTEM WHEN RESPONDING TO OUTSIDE WORLD)
SEEING ALL THE RUNNING DAEMONS, USE 'systemctl', TO STOP A SERVICE USE 'systemctl stop [NAME SERVICE]', TO DISABLE 'sytemctl disable [NAME SERVICE]'
TO SEE LISTENING PORTS, USE 'netstat'
FIREWALLS ARE MADE TO ALLOW AUTHORIZES ACCESS AND BLOCK UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS (ON LINUX FIREWALL = IPTABLES (PACKAGE MANAGER FOR NETWORK CONNECTIONS) + NETFILTER
FOR INTERACTING WITH THE FIREWALL, USE 'iptables'
