SECURITY IS ALWAYS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN CONVENIENCE AND SECURITY
FOR RISK ASSESSMENT, ALWAYS CONSIDER: SEVERITY OF RISK, PROBABILITY OF RISK, COST OF SOLVING IT, EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MEASURE
LINUX IS RELATIVELY SECURE, HOWEVER, IT CAN EASILY BE CONFIGURED TO BE UNSECURE; THEREFORE, NEVER ASSUME YOU ARE SECURE, UNLESS YOU TOOK MEASURES TO ENSURE THIS

LINUX IS MULTIUSER OPERATING SYSTEM, SO ROLES AND PERMISSIONS CAN BE SPLIT, WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE
THE SUPERUSER IS THE ADMINISTRATOR, ALSO CALLED ROOT ACCOUNT; ROOT IS ALL POWERFULL, SO IF SOMEONE HAS ACCESS TO ROOT, HE/SHE ALSO HAS ACCESS TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM
A WAY IN WHICH THIS IS SAFE, IS IF SOMEONE BREAKS INTO AN ACCOUNT, ONE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE ACCESS TO THE ROOT ACCOUNT, SO THAT ACCOUNT IS SHIELDED 
FURTHERMORE: PROCESSES ARE ALSO COUPLED SPECIFICALLY TO AN ACCOUNT, SO INTERFERENCES IS NOT EASY

WINDOWS IS EASIER TO HACK: THERE ARE MORE WINDOWS COMPUTERS AND THEIR USER BASE IS LESS TECHNICALLY INCLINED; ADDITIONALLY, LINUX IS OPEN-SOURCE, SO THAT SECURITY ISSUES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND THAN IN WINDOWS, WHERE ONLY MICROSOFT CAN INTRODUCE CODE
ALL LINUX PACKAGE REPOSITORIES USE PUBLIC KEYS TO ENSURE THAT NO MALICIOUS SOFTWARE WAS INJECTED AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE PACKAGES
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF USING CENTRAL REPOSITORIES IS THAT UPDATING ALL THE PACKAGES AND INSTALLING FIXES FOR KNOWN BUGS BECOMES VERY CONTROLLED AND EASY

SECURITY GUIDELINES: 
- SECURITY IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, ALWAYS KEEP SYSTEMS UP-TO-DATE AND ALWAYS CHECK WHETHER SYSTEM IS SECURE
- MINIMIZE SOFTWARE (NOT NEEDED, DON'T INSTALL IT), MINIMIZE SERVICES (NOT NEEDED, DON'T START THE PROCESS), WHEN SOFTWARE OR SERVICE IS NO LONGER NEEDED GET RID OF IT
- RUN SERVICES ON SEPARATE SYSTEMS, AS TO PREVENT ONE COMPROMISED SERVICE FROM AFFECTING THE OTHER SERVICES
- ENCRYPT ALL DATA THAT IS TRANSMITTED OVER A NETWORK
- AVOID USING SHARED ACCOUNTS, USERS AND SERVICES SHOULD HAVE SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WHEN POSSIBLE
- PROVIDE LIMITED OPTIONS FOR THE SUDO COMMAND, WHICH CAN BE CONFIGURED USING 'sudo visudo', HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF SWITCHING TO THE ROOT ACCOUNT AND EXECUTE SOMETHING THERE, IT IS STILL MUCH SAFER USING THE SUDO-COMMAND ON A LOCAL ACCOUNT
- LOCK OR DELETE UNUSED ACCOUNTS AND ENFORCE STRONG PASSWORD POLICIES, WITH CHANGING PASSWORDS REGULARLY; USE MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE
- USE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST AUTHORITY/PRIVILIGE, WHERE EVERY USER AND SERVICE SHOULD GET THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF PRIVILIGE FOR FUNCTIONING
- USE A FIREWALL, LINUX HAS NETFILTERS AND IPTABLES (FOR COMMUNICATING WITH NETFILTERS) INSTALLED AND CONFIGURED
- ENCRYPT DATA IF IT IS NOT ACTIVELY BEING USED ON YOUR DISK
- MONITOR LOGS, AND WHENEVER POSSIBLE, TRANSFER LOGS TO A DEDICATED LOG SERVICE
