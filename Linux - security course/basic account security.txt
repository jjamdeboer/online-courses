PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ATTACKS ARE ATTACKS THAT HAPPEN WHEN AN ACCOUNT GETS COMPROMISED AND PRIVILEGES ARE NOT WELL-MANAGED, THUS COMPROMISING THE WHOLE OR PART OF THE SYSTEM
MINIMIZE AMOUNTS OF USERS; SECURE THE ACCOUNTS
PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION MODULES (PAM) IS A CENTRAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM USED ON LINUX; PAM HAS MODULES WITH WHICH IT MANAGES SECURITY: 'auth' AUTHETNICATES USERS, 'account' VERIFIES ACCESS IS PERMITTED (FOR EXAMPLE: ACCESS IS ONLY PERMITTED DURING BUSINESS HOURS), 'password' CHANGES A USER'S PASSWORD, 'session' MANAGES SESSIONS

THERE ARE THREE USER TYPES ON A LINUX SYSTEM: ROOT/SUPERUSER (UID 0), SYSTEM USERS (UID < 1000), USERS (UID >= 1000)
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTS AND THE NORMAL ACCOUNTS, ONLY THE UID OF 0 IS SPECIAL, HOWEVER IT IS EASY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES TO HAVE THIS DIFFERENCE SO THAT IT IS EASILY SEEN WHAT ACCOUNTS ARE USED BY SERVICES/APPLICATIONS AND WHAT ACCOUNTS ARE USED BY HUMANS
/etc/passwd USED TO STORE THE HASHED PASSWORDS, HOWEVER, THAT FILE WAS ACCESSIBLE BY ALL USERS AND THE HASHED PASSWORDS COULD BE READ OUT AND CRACKED; THEREFORE, THE PASSWORDS ARE NOW REPLACES BY AN 'x' AND THE HASHED PASSWORDS ARE NOW STORED IN /etc/shadow, WHICH REQUIRES ROOT PRIVILEGE TO ACCESS

LOCKING OR UNLOCKING ACCOUNTS CAN BE DONE WITH 'passwd [OPTIONS]'
MOST LINUX SYSTEMS HAVE CENTRALIZED AUTHENTICATION, WHICH IS THEREFORE A WEAK SPOT
PREVENT THE ROOT FROM BEING ABLE TO LOG IN BY EMPTYING THE etc/securetty, SINCE THERE ARE ALL THE ACCOUNTS ROOT IS ABLE TO LOG IN TO
CHANGING THE PRIVILEGES AS IN WHO CAN EXECUTE WHAT WITH 'sudo', CONFIGURE 'sudo' USING 'sudo visudo'
