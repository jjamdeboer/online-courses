WHENEVER SOMEONE HAS PHYSICAL ACCESS TO A SYSTEM, ONE CAN PRESS THE POWER BUTTON AND ENTER SINGLE USER MODE AND BYPASS ALL THE SECURITY
KEEP UNAUTHORIZED PEOPLE OUT OF THE SERVER ROOMS

WHEN SERVERS ARE NOT DIRECTLY UNDER YOUR CONTROL (BUT UNDER MICROSOFT OR AMAZON, E.G., IN A DATA CENTER), CHECK THAT THAT DATA CENTER HAS: PHYSICAL SECURITY, MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION, ACCESS POLICIES, INCLUDING REVOKING ACCESS, BACKGROUND CHECKS ON EMPLOYEES
REALIZE THAT, SINCE DATA IS ON ANOTHER COMPUTER, SOMEONE ELSE IS ROOT THERE AND CAN ALWAYS ACCESS YOUR DATA, THEREFORE, ALWAYS ENCRYPT DATA IS STORED OUTSIDE ONE'S OWN COMPUTER

PROTECTING AGAINST PHYSICAL ATTACKS: BOOTING THE MACHINE IN SINGLE USER MODE DIDN'T (DOESN'T FOR LEGACY SYSTEMS) REQUIRE ROOT PASSWORD, BUT GIVES ROOT ACCESS TO THAT SYSTEM, THUS, ACCESS TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM
THIS CAN BE PREVENTED BY PROMPTING THE SYSTEM TO ASK FOR THE ROOT PASSWORD ON SINGLE USER MODE LOGINS, HOWEVER, THAT ONLY WORKS WHEN THE ROOT ACCOUNT DOES HAVE A PASSWORD SET, WHICH IS NOT DONE BY DEFAULT ON UBUNTU-BASED SYSTEMS
FIND ALL INSTANCES OF 'sushell' AND REPLACE THEM BY 'sulogin' TO ACHIEVE THIS
SETTING A ROOT PASSWORD CAN BE DONE BY SWITCHING TO ROOT AND THEN USE THE 'passwd'-COMMAND
HOWEVER, ALSO THIS CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED, BY NOT LETTING THE SULOGIN BOOT WITH THE DEFAULT INIT SYSTEM, BUT USING A SHELL AS AN INIT SYSTEM
THIS CAN ALSO BE PREVENTED, BY SETTING A PASSWORD ON THE BOOT LOADER, WHICH DOESN'T ALLOW FOR MAKING CHANGES ON STARTING THE SYSTEM UP, UNLESS PASSWORD IS PROVIDED
HOWEVER, ALSO THIS CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED, BY PLUGING IN AN ISO DISK OR USB AND THEN RUN 'TROUBLESHOOTING' AND 'RESCUE CURRENT SYSTEM' (FOR EXAMPLE)
THEREFORE, REMEMBER: PHYSICAL ACCESS MEANS TO HAVE VIRTUAL ACCESS AS WELL, SOME EXTRA MEASURES CAN BE TAKEN, BUT THE SYSTEM CANNOT BE COMPLETELY SECURED!

DATA CAN BE ENCRYPTED, THIS DATA SHOULD THEN BE DECRYPTED BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM, FOR WHICH THE USER HAS TO SUPPLY A KEY OF SOME SORT
PASSWORDS OR KEYS ARE ALWAYS THE WEAK LINK IN SUCH SYSTEMS, DON'T PUT IT ON THE MACHINE ITSELF ON A POST-IT OR IN THE MACHINE UNENCRYPTED
dm-crypt IS THE STANDARD FOR ENCRYPTING AND DECRYPTING DISKS ON LINUX, LINUX UNIFIED KEY SETUP (LUKS) IS A FRONT-END FOR dm-crypt; LUKS CAN ALSO BE USED FOR ENCRYPTING/DECRYPTING REMOVABLE MEDIA SUCH AS USB-STICKS OR DVD'S

USE 'cryptsetup' FOR ENCRYPTING ANY HARDWARE, THIS WILL REMOVE ALL THE DATA THAT IS ON THAT DRIVE
ANOTHER THING THAT IS WISE TO DO BEFORE ENCRYPTING, IS TO PUT RANDOM DATA ON THE DRIVE, USING 'shred', SO THAT IT IS HARDER TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENCRYPTED DATA AND RANDOM BITS
TO ENCRYPT EXISTING DATA: MAKE A BACKUP OF THE DATA, MOVE IT TO ANOTHER DRIVE, WIPE THE DRIVE, FILL IT WITH RANDOM DATA, ENCRYPT THE DRIVE AND THEN PUT THE BACKUP ON THIS ENCRYPTED DRIVE

ALTHOUGH PHYSICAL ACCESS MIGHT BE DIFFICULT, A REBOOT COULD BE FORCED BY REPEATING CTRL+ALT+DELETE; SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISABLE THIS
