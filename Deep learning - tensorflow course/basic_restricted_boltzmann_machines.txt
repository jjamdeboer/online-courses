RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINES ARE AUTOENCODERS
RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINES CAN BE USED TO RECOMMEND ITEMS, SINCE PREFERENCES CAN BE LEARNED BY THEM
SHALLOW NEURAL NETWORKS WITH TWO LAYERS, CONSISTING ONLY OF A VISIBLE AND HIDDEN LAYER, AUTOENCODERS; RESTRICTED BECAUSE NEURONS WITHIN LAYERS ARE NOT CONNECTED
USED FOR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION, FEATURE EXTRACTION, IMAGE RECOGNITION

FOWARD PASS -> ACTIVATION FUNCTION (DECIDING WHICH NEURONS IN HIDDEN LAYER 'FIRE') -> BACKWARD PASS (USES SAME WEIGHTS AND BIASES AS IN FORWARD PASS) RECONSTRUCTS THE IMAGE -> COMPARISON INPUT AND OUTPUT

GREAT WITH UNLABELED DATA, EXTRACTS IMPORTANT FEATURES, REDUCES DIMENSION OF INPUT
RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINES TAKE STOCHASTIC APPROACH, CONTRARY TO MOST AUTOENCODERS THAT ARE DETERMINISTIC

THE BIAS IS SHARED AMONG THE VISIBLE NODES AND (ANOTHER) BIAS IS SHARED AMONG THE HIDDEN NODES
