COMPANIES ARE OFTEN:
- SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS: ONE OWNER WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE IN CASE OF DEBTS
- PARTNERSHIPS: MULTIPLE PERSONS OWN A COMPANY WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE IN CASE OF DEBTS
- LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES: COMBINATION OF OTHER THREE: OFFERS LEGAL PROTECTION, SO NO RESPONSIBILITY IN CASE OF DEBTS
- CORPORATIONS: B.V./ GROUP OF PEOPLE AUTHORIZED TO ACT AS SINGLE ENTITY WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE IN CASE OF DEBTS, BUT PEOPLE AREN'T

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT: PRODUCTION, HUMAN RESOURCES, CUSTOMER SERVICE, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, PRODUCT DELIVERY, 
    LOGISTICS, ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (SOFTARE FOR EACH OF THE PREVIOUS AND PLANNING THESE AND 
    GIVES OVERVIEW OF HOW WELL-FUNCTIONING EACH PART IS)
INFORMATION SYSTEMS: DATABASE RELATED TO COMPANIES' PERFORMANCE + SOFTWARE THAT TRACKS PROCESSES AND 
    GENERATES REPORTS FOR EACH DEPARTMENT

MARKETING:
- WHO WILL USE IT
- HOW AFFORDABLE IT IS TO THEM
- HOW ACCESSIBLE IT IS TO THEM
SO, OF THE TARGET GROUP, CONSIDER:
- DEMOGRAPHICS
- BUYING BEHAVIOURS
- LIFESTYLE
DIFFERENT COMPANIES:
- FOLLOWERS: NOT MARKET LEADER
- MARKET LEADER: MOST SUCCESSFUL ONE ON THE MARKET
- NICHERS: HAVING SPECIAL NICHE
- CHALLENGERS: GROWING COMPANIES THAT MIGHT OUTGROW MARKET LEADERS
CONSIDER PRODUCT, ITS PRICE, THE PROMOTIONS THAT ARE USED TO PRESENT PRODUCT AND THE PLACE WHERE THE PRODUCT IS BEING SOLD

MARKETING: OBTAINING POTENTIAL SALES; TASKS OF SALES DEPARTMENT CONCERN THE ACTUAL SALES BEING MADE
