PLAN:
WHAT IS THE PRODUCT GOING TO BE?
HOW DO YOU SELL IT?
WHAT WILL YOU DO IF IT FAILS?

MAKE SURE TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN FOR YOUR METHODS, SO THAT, IN CASE OF FAILURE, YOU ARE FLEXIBLE TO
    START OR CREATE SOMETHING SIMILAR, BUT OF DIFFERENT CONCEPT (PIVOTING). THIS CAN ALSO BE DONE WHEN
    THE IDEA TAKES TOO LONG TO BE EXECUTED, SO THAT IN THE MEANTIME SOMETHING ELSE CAN BE SOLD
    HAVE A VISION
ANOTHER, NON-EXCLUSIVE, TACTIC TO SELL EARLIER IS TO SELL THE MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT (CORE PRODUCT)
    THIS HAS ADVANTAGE THAT YOU CAN ASK CUSTOMERS THEIR PREFERENCES EARLIER, 
    SO YOU WOULDN'T WASTE DEVELOPMENT TIME
    THE MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT CAN OFTEN BE MADE WITH OPEN SOURCE CODE IF YOU CREATE SOMETHING CODE-BASED
USE MEASUREMENT/METRICS TO KEEP TRACK OF THE PROGRESS, SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE ACTION IN TIME
    ALSO USE THIS TO GET INVESTMENTS OR KEEP INVESTORS
RETENTION >= GROWTH (RETENTION FIGURES >= GROWTH FIGURES). GROWTH ONLY FOCUSES ON NEW CUSTOMERS, RETENTION
    ALSO ON EXISTING CUSTOMERS
ITERATION: USING THE SAME PRODUCT FOR DIFFERENT CONSUMER (REDESIGN IT SO TO FIT A DIFFERENT MARKET)
    ONLY DO THIS WHEN IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE
ALSO: SELL PIECES OF YOUR PRODUCT, IF THEY CAN BE USFUL TO OTHERS, THAT WAY YOU STILL HAVE INCOME
THE FIRST CUSTOMERS ARE REFERRED TO AS IDLE INTEREST, BUT GROWTH IN POPULARITY IS KNOWN AS PRODUCT MARKET FIT
BE YOUR OWN PR IN THE BEGINNING, SINCE YOU KNOW MOST AND BEST WHAT THE VISION OF THE COMPANY IS
WHEN HIRING CONSIDER DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TO BE IMPORTANT TO WIDEN YOUR SCOPE AND SPECIALTY WITHIN
    YOUR COMPANY. THE FIRST 10 PEOPLE YOU HIRE, MATTER THE MOST. YOU CAN MAKE RETROACTIVELY MAKE PEOPLE 
    FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANY AND OF COURSE GIVE AWAY SHARES OF THE COMPANY
TELL PERSONEL THE SOLUTION TO THE COMPANY'S PROBLEMS AFTER YOU SOLVED THEM, THIS WILL ENLARGE TRUST
    SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS YOURSELF, WITHOUT APPEARING TROUBLED BEFORE THE TEAM

ORDER OF STARTING UP:
- FORMATION
- EQUITY
- FUNDRAISING
- HIRING
- DOING BUSINESS

TELL POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF YOUR SERVICE OR PRODUCT SO THAT THEY CAN TELL WHETHER THEY ARE INTERESTED:
- THEY WILL TELL WHETHER THEY WILL BE INTERESTED
- THEY MIGHT GIVE AN INDICATION WHAT THEY WILL PAY
- THEY MIGHT TELL HOW TO IMPROVE IT
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH ADVERTISEMENT IS MOST EFFECTIVE, SO TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS

TO TEST AND FIND NEW CUSTOMERS THAT CAN TEST AS WELL:
- FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS A FIRST ROUND
- TARGETED MARKETING
- PR COMPANIES
TARGET ON BEHAVIOUR (DOES IT SELL TO THESE KIND OF PEOPLE) RATHER THAN DEMOGRAPHICS (MEN WILL BUY THIS)

DECIDE WHAT KIND OF COMPANY YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE:
- SOME BECOME LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (LLC)
- OTHERS A SOLE TRADERSHIP
- CORPORATIONS IF YOU NEED A LOT OF INVESTMENT RELATIVELY (SINCE SHAREHOLDERS PROVIDE THESE)
    YOU CAN ALSO CONSIDER PAYING PEOPLE WITH SHARES. WILLINGNESS TO GIVE SHARES ATTRACTS INVESTORS.
    CREATE SHARES WHEN:
        - WHEN YOU HAVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO PROTECT
        - WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SELL YOUR PRODUCTS AND MAKE MONEY
        - WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU FOR LEGALLY PROTECTING YOURSELF

ORDER OF GROWING:
- ACQUISITION (GETTING CUSTOMERS)
- ACTIVATION (SEE HOW THEY LIKE IT)
- RETENTION (TAKE ACTIONS TO KEEP EXISTING CUSTOMERS)
- REFERRAL (GET NEW CUSTOMERS, OFTEN BY WORD OF MOUTH)
- REVENUE

BEING YOUR OWN PR:
- GIVE A CLEAR STORY ABOUT YOURSELF AS A PERSON
- DEFINE YOUR GOALS AND YOUR AUDIENCE
- READ ABOUT THE SUBJECT AND ORDER IT
- CREATING THE PERFECT FORMULATION
- LISTEN AND BE A SOURCE OF INFORMATION WHEN ASKED

HIRING PEOPLE:
- YOUR VISION
- REQUIRED SPECIALTIES
- HIRE TEAM LEADER FIRST
- HIRE THE REST
- OVERSEE THE TEAM
- REASSESS THE TEAM ONCE 'COMPLETE'
- DESIGN INCENTIVE STRUCTURE TO KEEP PEOPLE MOTIVATED TO WORK FOR YOU
