GIT IS A THREE-TREE STRUCTURE:
- WORKING DIRECTORY
- STAGING AREA (LOCAL REPOSITORY)
- REPOSITORY

COMMAND FOR MOVING FILES FROM WORKING DIRECTORY TO STAGING AREA: git add [FILE(S) TO ADD]
COMMAND FOR MOVING FILES FROM THE STAGING AREA INTO THE REPOSITORY: git commit

INSTALLING AND UPDATING GIT ON LINUX: sudo apt install git

CONFIGURATION OF GIT:
- SYSTEM (ON MACHINE): git config --system
- USER (ON ACCOUNT): git config --global
- PROJECT (ON FILES): git config

TO INITIALIZE A GIT REPOSITORY, GO INSIDE THE WORKING DIRECTORY AND TYPE (CREATES .git-FILE): git init

FOR CHECKING THE STATUS OF WHICH FILES ARE TRACKED AND WHICH FILES ARE NOT AND HOW MANY COMMITS HAVE BEEN: git status

FOR GETTING HELP (ON ANY COMMAND): git help/git help [NAME COMMAND]

FOR IGNORING SOME FILES, CREATE .gitignore-FILE

FOR CREATING BRANCHES (STANDARD IS MASTER, BUT USEFUL NOT TO KEEP WORKING IN MASTER IN CASE SOMETHING GOES AWRY): git branch [BRANCH NAME]
FOR OVERVIEW OF BRANCHES AND WHICH ONE IS ACTIVE: git branch
FOR REMOVING BRANCH: git branch -d [NAME BRANCH] (LOCALLY)/git push origin --delete [NAME BRANCH] (REMOTELY)
TO SWITCH BETWEEN BRANCHES: git checkout [NAME BRANCH TO SWITCH TO]
MERGING ANOTHER BRANCH INTO CURRENT BRANCH: git merge [NAME BRANCH]
