ADDING A REMOTE REPOSITORY: git remote add [NAME REMOTE REPOSITORY, ADVICED: origin] [URL TO REMOTE REPOSITORY, SUCH AS: https://gitlab.com/AntoniusCollective/hello-online-repository.git]
PUSHING THE LOCAL PROJECT TO THE REMOTE REPOSITORY: git push -u [NAME OF REMOTE REPOSITORY IT SHOULD BE PUSHED TO, OFTEN: origin] [WHICH BRANCH TO PUSH, OFTEN: master]
NOTE THAT THE LOCAL REPOSITORY IS STILL THERE, THERE IS SIMPLY ANOTHER LAYER ADDED ON TOP OF THE PROJECT, NAMELY: THE REMOTE REPOSITORY

CREATING A README.md (md STAND FOR 'MARK DOWN'), IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC REMOTE REPOSITORIES

TO PUSH THE LOCAL REPOSITORY TO THE REMOTE REPOSITORY: git push

FOR COPYING A REMOTE PROJECT INTO A LOCAL DIRECTORY: git clone [URL OF ONLINE REPOSITORY, SUCH AS: https://gitlab.com/AntoniusCollective/hello-online-repository.git]

A (REMOTE) REPOSITORY CAN BE FORKED/COPIED FOR EXPERIMENTS WITH/ON (OTHER PEOPLE'S) PROJECTS
A NEW LOCAL DIRECTORY NEEDS TO BE USED TO PULL/CLONE THE PROJECT
A NEW REMOTE REPOSITORY NEEDS TO BE MADE TO PUSH THE CHANGES

WHEN CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE REMOTE REPOSITORY, THE CHANGES NEED TO BE PULLED LOCALLY: git pull

FOR SHOWING THE WHOLE LOG: git log
FOR SHOWING ONLY A RECENT NUMBER OF COMMITS: git log -n[NUMBER THAT NEEDS TO BE SHOWN]
FOR SHOWING COMMITS SINCE A SPECIFIC DAY: git log --since=[YEAR-MONTH (NUMERIC)-DAY (NUMERIC)]

A HEAD IS A REFERENCE TO A COMMIT-OBJECT, IT IS OFTEN THE NAME OF THE CURRENT BRANCH, BUT NOT ALWAYS. IT IS A REFERENCE TO THE LATEST HEAD THAT THE COMMIT WAS DONE BY
EVERY REPOSITORY CONTAINS A HEAD NAMED 'MASTER' BY DEFAULT
