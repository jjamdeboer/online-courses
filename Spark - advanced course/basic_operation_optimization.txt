STATISTICAL OPERATIONS ON NUMERICAL RDD'S: MIN, MAX, SUM, VARIANCE, STANDARD DEVIATION, MEAN
MAPARTITION OR FOREACHPARTITION ALSO FUNCTIONS
FOLD IS EQUAL TO REDUCE, WITH A ZERO GIVEN ACCUMULATOR
AGGREGATE EQUAL TO FOLD WITH TWO FUNCTIONS: FIRST ACCUMULATES AND THE SECOND COMBINES THE RESULT FROM EACH PARTITION ACCUMULATOR
COUNTBYVALUE COUNTS THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES OF EACH VALUE (MAPPING + COUNTBYKEY)
REDUCEBYKEY: REDUCES FOR EACH VALUE OF A KEY; AGGREGATEBYKEY AND FOLDBYKEY ALSO EXIST
GROUPBYKEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED, SINCE IT SHUFFLES EVERYTHING
LOOKUP RETURNS ALS VALUES FOR SPECIFIED KEY
MAPVALUES APPLIES MAP FUNCTION TO EACH VALUE WITHOUT CHANGING THE KEY

RATHER THAN GROUPBYKEY, USE AGGREGATEBYKEY FOR AVERAGING (SINCE IT IS FIRST AGGREGATED WITHIN THE PPARTITION BEFORE SENT TO OTHER NODES) AND REDUCEBYKEY FOR GIVING THE FIRST VALUE OF A KEY

ACTIONS ARE NOT LAZY AND THUS 'BLOCKING OPERATIONS'; ASYNCHRONOUS ACTIONS ARE LAZY

WHEN OUTPUT IS GENERATED, USE STANDARD SAVE API'S WHERE POSSIBLE (HADOOP/HDFS)
WHEN SAVING TO ODBC OR JDBC USE HADOOP DBOUTPUTFORMAT AND SPARKCONTEXT SAVEASHADOOPDATASET
FOR MESSAGE QUEUES OR REST ENDPOINTS, DO USE FOREACHPARTITION

BROADCAST VARIABLES: READ-ONLY GLOBALS SENT TO WORKERS THAT NEED THEM BY DRIVER
BITTORRENT-PROTOCOL USED BY SPARK: NODES SHARE BROADCAST VARIABLES WITH EACH OTHER AS NOT TO OVERLOAD THE MASTER
