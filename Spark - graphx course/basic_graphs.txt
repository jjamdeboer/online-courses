GRAPHX USES PROPERTY GRAPH WHICH IS DIRECTED MULTIGRAPH TOGETHER WITH SPARK'S RESILIENT DISTRIBUTED DATASETS
DATA-PARALLEL: HADOOP, SPARK
GRAPH-PARALLEL: PREGEL, GRAPHLAB, GIRAPH
BOTH: GRAPHX, EXCEPT VISUALIZATION OF GRAPHS WHICH CAN BE BORROWED FROM GRAPH-PARALLEL PROGRAMS

HADOOP ETL INITIAL GRAPH, MAKES SUBGRAPH AND LOADS THIS INTO GRAPHLAB AND THIS DATA IS ANALYZED BY HIVE

PROPERTY GRAPH: VERTICES/NODES (ID, ATTRIBUTE/NAME), EDGES (SOURCE NODE ID, DESTINATION ID, RELATIONSHIP) AND TRIPLETS (COMBINATION OF TWO VERTICES AND THEIR EDGE)

RDD: DATA STORED AS IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED COLLECTION OF OBJECTS; BOTH SEEN AS COLLECTION OR GRAPH BY GRAPHX WHATEVER IS PREFERRED
RDD WITH EDGES AND RDD WITH VERTICES NEEDED BEFORE INITIALIZING GRAPH

GRAPHX PROCESSING LIBRARY AND FAILS TO VISUALIZE THE DATA; GEPHI OR GRAPHLAB ShOULD BE USED FOR THIS
VIEWS CONTAINING TRIPLETS CAN ALSO BE USED, BUT NOT SO PRETTY; USE GRAPH.triplet.collect TO COLLECT THE TRIPLET AS A COLLECTION/RDD
FUNCTIONS: numEdges/numVertices, inDegree/outDegree/degree (NUMBER OF IN/OUT/TOTAL EDGES OF A VERTIX)
GRAPH.vertices/edges/triplets RETURN RDD/COLLECTION AND NEED TO BE COLLECTED TO BE LISTED/LOOPED OVER
PAGERANK DETERMINES POPULARITY OF VERTICES

SINCE RDD IMMUTABLE, EVERY GRAPH IN GRAPHX IS UNIQUE, BUT NEW GRAPHS ARE CREATED FROM THE OLD GRAPHS
PROPERTY OPERATORS CHANGE ATTRIBUTES OF GRAPH: mapVertices/mapEdges/mapTriplets (CHANGES ATTRIBUTES OF ALL VERTICES/EDGES/TRIPLETS)
STRUCTURAL OPERATORS ALTER STRUCTURE OF GRAPH: reverse (CREATES GRAPH WITH ALL EDGE DIRECTIONS REVERSED), subgraph RETURNS PORTION OF GRAPH AS NEW GRAPH (REMOVING NON-ATTACHED NODES OR EDGES LEADING NOWHERE), groupEdges (GROUPS/BUNDLES EDGES BETWEEN TWO NODES TOGETHER), partitionBy (GROUPBY WITH CanonicalRandomVertexCut, EdgePartition1D, EdgePartition2D AND RandomVertexCut OPTIONS)

NEIGHBOURHOOD AGGREGATION EXRACTS DATA FROM NEIGHBOURHOODS OF VERTICES OR EDGES; USED BY PAGERANK, AGGREGATEMESSAGES (MAPS USER-DEFINED SEND MESSAGE FUNCTION TO EACH TRIPLET IN A GRAPH AND THEN A USER-DEFINED MERGE FUNCTION MERGES ALL MESSAGES FROM DESTINATION VERTICES, RETURNS VERTEXRDD WITH MERGED MESSAGES)
ALTERNATIVE FOR AGGREGATEMESSAGES ARE COLLECTNEIGHBORSIDS AND COLLECTNEIGHBORS BOTH FROM GRAPHOPS
FOR CACHING THE GRAPH INTO MEMORY, USE THE CACHE-FUNCTION
OTHER FUNCTIONS: CONNECTEDCOMPONENTS (LABELS EACH COMPONENT OF GRAPH WITH ID OF LOWEST-NUMBER VERTEX) AND TRIANGLECOUNT (COUNTS NUMBER OF TRIANGLES AT EACH NODE, HAVING TWO EDGES WITH DIFFERENT NEIGHBORING NODES)
