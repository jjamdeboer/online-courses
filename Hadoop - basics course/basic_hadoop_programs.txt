MAPREDUCE:
DOES NOT ALLOW FOR DEPENDENCIES WITHIN THE DATA
MAP IS REALLY A MAP SUCH AS IN A LANGUAGE LIKE PYTHON (OPERATION OF A FUNCTION ON AN INPUT SPLIT)
THE OUTPUT IS SENT TO (DIFFERENT) SO-CALLED REDUCERS, MERGING INPUT OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENT NODES AND DIFFERENT MAPS
BEFORE THE UNSTRUCTURED DATA GETS MAPPED, IT IS CHANGED TO KEY-VALUE PAIRS; THE MAPPING MIGHT CHANGE THE KEY AND THE REDUCERS GROUPS TOGETHER IDENTICAL KEYS IT MIGHT RECEIVE FROM DIFFERENT NODES APPLYING SOME MAPPING
FOR THIS REASON IT IS CALLED MAPREDUCE, SINCE FIRST IT IS MAPPED AND THEN GROUPED/MERGED/REDUCED

PIG AND HIVE:
TRANSLATE HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES IN MAPREDUCE JOBS (SO CODE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA)
IF THE HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES LACK SOMETHING, THE USER CAN EASILY SWITCH TO JAVA AND USE THE PREDEFINED JAVA FUNCTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN PIG AND HIVE
PIG WAS DEVELOPED BY YAHOO AND MOVED TO APACHE; IT'S LANGUAGE IS PIGLATIN, A DATAFLOW LANGUAGE AND CAN BE USED ON RELATIONAL DATABASES AND UNSTRUCTURED OR NESTED DATA; IT SUPPORTS LOOPING CONSTRUCTS, INFINITE MEMORY MODEL AND CONDITIONAL CONSTRUCTS WHEN EXTENDED BY USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS AND THEREFORE BECOMING TURING COMPLETE; IT DOES NOT NEED A SCHEMA TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE ON DATA
PIG HAS A LANGUAGE (PIGLATIN) AND EXECUTION (LOCAL OR DISTRIBUTED) ENVIRONMENT; LOCAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE GOOD FOR TESTING; PIG CAN BE RUN USING SCRIPTS: pig runscript.pig OR INTERACTIVELY, WHICH IS STARTED BY SIMPLY TYPING pig WITHOUT ARGUMENTS (SIMILARLY TO PYTHON)
HIVE WAS DEVELOPED BY FACEBOOK; A DECLARATIVE LANGUAGE, WHERE ONE STATES THE DESIRED OUTCOME AND THIS LANGUAGE CONSTRUCTS THE DATAFLOWS TO MAKE IT SO; IT DOES NEED A SCHEMA, UNLIKE PIG; ALSO HERE, HIVEQL IS NOT TURING COMPLETE BY ITSELF BUT CAN BE MADE SO BY ADDING USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
HIVE CAN BE RUN INTERACTIVELY TYPING hive WITHOUT ARGUMENT (LIKE PIG) OR USING SCRIPTS TYPING: hive -f runscript

FLUME, SQOOP AND OOZIE:
FLUME IS OPEN-SOURCE AND USED FOR BY CLOUDERA THAT CAN BE USED FOR AGGREGATING AND MOVING DATA AROUND IN HADOOP; IT IS OFTEN USED FOR MOVING ALL THE LOG-FILES FROM THE NODES AND MOVE THEM TO HDFS
FLUME CREATES DATAFLOWS BY CREATING LOGICAL NODES AND CONNECTING THESE TO SOURCES AND SINKS
SQOOP IS OPEN-SOURCE AND USED FOR MOVING DATA BETWEEN RELATIONAL DATABASES AND HADOOP, USING MAPREDUCE OPERATIONS; CAN BE USED TO IMPORT DATA INTO HADOOP
OOZIE IS OPEN-SOURCE AND USED TO MANAGE HADOOP JOBS; OOZIE ACTIONS TAKE PLACE SEQUANTIALLY (CAN BE MADE GRAPHICAL IN A DIRECTED ACYCLICAL GRAPH); WRITTEN IN XML AND HPDL AND STORED IN WORKFLOW.XML
