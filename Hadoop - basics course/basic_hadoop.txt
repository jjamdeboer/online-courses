HADOOP IS A FREE AND OPEN SOURCE FRAMEWORK OF THE APACHE FOUNDATION
HADOOP IS WRITTEN IN JAVA AND USES GOOGLE'S MAPREDUCE TECHNOLOGY AS ITS FOUNDATION
STRUCTURED, UNSTRUCTURED OR SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA CAN BE PROCESSED BY HADOOP

HADOOP IS COMPUTING PARALLELLY USING A LOT OF COMPUTERS. IT OPERATES IN BATCHES AND IS THEREFORE SLOW
IN PLACE UPDATES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN HADOOP, BUT APPENDING EXISTING DATA IS POSSIBLE

HADOOP COPIES THE DATA ON MULTIPLE PLACES, SO THAT IF ONE COMPUTER BREAKS DOWN, THE DATA IS SAVED

HADOOP IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ONLINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING APPLICATIONS (OLTP) (RANDOM ACCES TO STRUCTURED DATA) AND ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING (OLAP) (SEQUENTIAL ACCESS TO STRUCTURED DATA), WHICH CAN BOTH BE DONE ON RELATIONAL DATABASES
HADOOP NOT FIT FOR TRANSACTIONS, SINCE IT DOES NOT HAVE RANDOM ACCES; NOT GOOD AT SEQUENTIALLY ACCESSING THE DATA; IT IS NOT FIT FOR ACCESSING A LOT OF SMALL FILES; NOT FIT FOR LOW LATENCY DATA ACCESS; NOT FIT FOR INTENSIVE CALCULATION WITH ONLY SMALL PART OF THE DATA OR SMALL AMOUNT OF DATA; ONLY GOOD IN PARALLEL ACCESSING DATA
HADOOP COMPLEMENTS OLTP AND OLAP, SINCE IT IS MAINLY USED TO MANAGE UNSTRUCTURED DATA, UNFIT FOR RELATIONAL DATABASES

OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS BASED ON HADOOP: ECLIPSE (IDE), LUCENE (TEXT SEARCH ENGINE), HBASE (HADOOP DATABASE), HIVE (DATA WAREHOUSE TO EXTRACT, TRANSFORM AND LOAD (ETL) DATA), PIG (HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE TO APPLY MAPREDUCE), SPARK (CLUSTER COMPUTING FRAMEWORK), ZOOKEEPER (CENTRALIZED CONFIGRUATION SERVICE AND NAMING REGISTRY FOR LARGE DISTRIBUTIONS), AMBARI (GUI FOR HADOOP), AVRO (DATA SERIALIZATION SYSTEM), UIMA (ANALYSIS OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA), YARN (LARGE-SCALE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR BIG DATA), MAPREDUCE (SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK FOR BIG DATA)
