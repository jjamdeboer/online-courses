HADOOP ADMINISTRATION INCLUDES:
- ADDING NODES TO A CLUSTER (MOST EASILY DONE WITH AMBARI AND REQUIRES THE IP-ADDRESS OF THE NODE; BIGINSIGHTS IS AUTOMATICALLY INSTALLED ON THE NEW/CHILD NODE; UNDER AMBARI -> HOSTS -> ADD NEW HOST; REMOVE ALL SERVICES BEFORE REMOVING A NODE)
- VERIFYING THE HEALTH OF A CLUSTER (USE: hdfs dfsadmin --report)
- STOPPING/STARTING COMPONENTS (UNDER AMBARI -> SERVICES -> START/STOP SERVICES)
- CONFIGURATION (THREE XML-FILES WHICH STORE THE PARAMETERS: CORE-SITE.XML (BOTH PARAMETERS OF HADOOP AND MAPREDUCE), HDFS-SITE.XML (ETC.), MAPRED-SITE.XML (ETC.); THE SERVICES NEED TO BE STOPPED BEFORE THEY CAN BE CONFIGURED)
- RACK TOPOLOGY (CAN BE CONFIGURED USING OWN SCRIPTS AND A CONFIGURATION FILE POINTING TOWARDS THAT SCRIPT)

NOTA BENE: FOR THE IBM-CLOUD, GO ONLINE, START THE CLUSTER THAT IS CREATED AND LAUNCH A NEW (AMBARI) CONSOLE USING THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD AS INDICATED
