HIVE DEVELOPED BY FACEBOOK
THIS SINCE THERE WAS NEED FOR HANDLING EVER-INCREASING DATA SETS
THEIR TRADITIONAL DATA WAREHOUSES/RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS) TOOK TOO LONG TO PROCESS THAT DATA -> MOVE DATA INTO HADOOP
HOWEVER, HADOOP WAS NOT EASY FOR MANY DEVELOPERS THERE -> BRING DATABASE CONCEPTS TO HADOOP (THAT IS WHAT HIVE DOES)

HIVE IS DATA WAREHOUSE SYSTEM ON TOP OF HADOOP, FACILITATES EASY DATA-SUMMARIZATION AND AD-HOC QUERIES AND ANALYSES
HIVE PROVIDES SQL-LIKE INTERFACE (HIVEQL/HQL) FOR HADOOP WITH KNOWN SYNTAX
DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE (DDL); DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE (DML)
SQL QUERIES TRANSLATED BEHIND THE SCENES INTO MAPREDUCE PROGRAMS
THE CATALOG MAPS FILE STRUCTURE TO TABULAR FORM TO GET FEELING OF A DATABASE

HIVE IS NOT FIT FOR REAL-TIME PROCESSING, BUT IS FIT FOR ANALYTICS ON HUMONGOUS DATA SETS; LATENCIES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN TRADITIONAL DATABASES
THE QUERIES ARE SLOW, BUT IT IS FLEXIBLE
IT IS NOT SQL-92-COMPLIANT: DOES NOT PROVIDE INSERT, UPDATE OR DELETE OF ROWS; DOES NOT SUPPORT TRANSACTIONS; DOES NOT SUPPORT SUBQUERIES VERY EASILY

HIVE IS EASY TO WRITE: WORDCOUNT IN MAPREDUCE ~63 LINES -> HIVE ~7 LINES
PIG AND HIVE ARE OFTEN USED ALONGSIDE: HIVE IS GOOD FOR QUERYING, WHEREAS PIG IS GOOD FOR MONITORING DATA STREAMS AND EXTRACTING, TRANSFORMING AND LOADING DATA (ETL)

ACCESS OF HIVE IS VIA THE HIVE WEB INTERFACE, OR VIA AN APPLICATION: JDBC, ODBC OR THRIFT CLIENT (USING THE THRIFT SERVER/HIVE SERVER); OR VIA A COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI) (BEELINE) IN THIN CLIENT MODE THIS CONNECTION IS VIA JDBC, AS CLIENT TO HIVES SERVER OR IN EMBEDDED MODE (CONNECTING TO DRIVER (COMPILER, OPTIMIZER, EXECUTER) DIRECTLY, LIKE THE HIVE WEB INTERFACE, OR THE HIVE SERVER ITSELF)
HIVE HAS A METASTORE/CATALOG
NEWER HIVE HAS ALSO A SEPARATE HIVE CATALOG BASED ON DDL AND PROVIDES READ/WRITE INTERFACES FOR PIG AND MAPREDUCE
THE DRIVER DOES:
- THE QUERY COMPILER TURN QUERIES INTO DAGS OR MAPREDUCE TASKS
- THE EXECUTION EXECUTES IT IN PROPER DEPENDENCY ORDER

HIVE HAS LIB- (JAVA CODE FOR HIVE FUNCTIONALITY), BIN- (HIVE SCRIPTS) AND CONF-DIRECTORIES (CONFIGURATION FILES)

METASTORE CONSISTS OF SERVICE AND DATASTORE
METASTORE STORES DATA EITHER EMBEDDED (IN-PROCESS DATABASE AND METASTORE; ONLY FOR TESTING SINCE IT ONLY ALLOWS FOR ONE USER); LOCAL (IN-PROCESS METASTORE, OUT-OF-PROCESS DATABASE); REMOTE (OUT-OF-PROCESS DATABASE AND METASTORE)
