DATA IS STORED HIERARCHICALLY AS DATABASE (HOLDER OF TABLES) > TABLES (ONE SCHEMA) > PARTITIONS (VIRTUAL COLUMN WHICH WHERE THE DATA, SINCE THIS CAN BE DEFINED IN DIFFERENT WAYS, ONE TABLE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE PARTITIONS) > BUCKETS (PER PARTITION, DATA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO BUCKETS)
DATA DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE PARTITIONS AND BUCKETS, BUT THIS SPEEDS UP THE PROCESS

COMMAND FOR SHOWING DATABASES: show databases;
COMMAND FOR DESCRIBING A DATABASE: describe database [NAME DATABASE];
COMMAND FOR DESCRIBING A DATABASE IN DETAIL: describe database extendEd [NAME DATABASE];
COMMAND FOR SWITCHING TO DATABASE: use [NAME DATABASE];
COMMAND FOR DELETING DATABASE: drop database (if exists) [NAME DATABASE];
COMMAND FOR ALTERING THE DBPROPERTIES (DATABASE METADATA, SUCH AS AUTHOR): alter database [NAME DATABASE] set dbproperties ([NAME PROPERTY] - [NEW VALUE]);

DATA TYPES FOR COLUMNS:
- INTEGERS
- BOOLEAN
- FLOATS
- STRING
- DATE
- BINARY
BUILT UP FROM PREVIOUS TYPES:
- ARRAY
- LIST
- DICTIONARY
- SET
ON COMPARISON, ALL INTEGER TYPES ARE CAST TO LARGER OF THE TWO TYPES, FLOATS ARE CAST TO DOUBLES AND INTEGERS ARE CAST TO DOUBLES

INTERNAL TABLES: DROPPING A TABLE ACTUALLY DELETES THE DATA AND THE METADATA OF HIVE
EXTERNAL TABLE: DROPPING A TABLE DOES NOT DELETE THE DATA, BUT DOES DELETE THE METADATA OF HIVE

ALTERING TABLES CAN FOR EXAMPLE RENAME THE TABLE OR ADD/REMOVE COLUMNS

INDEXES ARE ADVANCED TOPIC ARE ONLY MENTIONED
