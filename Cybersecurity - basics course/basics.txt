SECURITY ASSETS ARE THE THINGS OF VALUE THAT NECESSITATE SECURITY MEASURES

PRIVACY: IS ABOUT CONTENT, NOT IDENTITY
ANONIMITY: IS ABOUT IDENTITY, NOT NECESSARILY CONTENT
PSEUDONOMITY: IS ABOUT IDENTITY, USING AN ALIAS, AND THEREFORE A BIT ABOUT CONTENT TOO

THREATS ARE THE CONCRETE MEANS ADVERSERIES USE TO OBTAIN OUT SECURITY ASSETS (WHICH CAN INCLUDE CONTENT AND IDENTITY)
THREAT LANDSCAPE IS COMBINATION OF THREATS AND ADVERSARIES ONE HAS
RISK ASSESSMENT HAS ASSET/VALIDATION AS VERY FIRST STAGES/INPUT
SECURITY IS A BALANCE BETWEEN RISK AND OPPORTUNITY, OR SECURITY AND USABILITY

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES, E.G. CIA-TRIAD:
CONFIDENTIALITY: HOW SECRET/PRIVATE THE ASSET NEEDS TO BE
INTEGRITY: HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THE ASSET REMAINS USEFUL/UNDAMAGED
AVAILABILITY: HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THE ASSET REMAINS INTACT/UNDESTROYED
CIA IS THE ORIGINAL ATTRIBUTE ASSESSMENT, BUT IT IS OUTDATED AND NOT FIT TO SHARE WITH BUSINESS-ORIENTED PEOPLE
ALTERNATIVE IS THE PARKERIAN HEXAD; ADDS THREE POINTS: 
UTILITY: HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THE ASSET RETAINS ITS INTENDED PURPOSE/USEFUL
POSSESSION: (LOST OF) CONTROL OVER AN ASSET
AUTHENTICITY: HOW IMPORTANT THE AUTHOR/CREATOR OF ASSET IS
ADDITIONALLY, THESE ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED:
NON-REPUDIATION: HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT AN ASSET/CONTENT CAN BE TRACKED TO SOMEONE/ERASED; I.E.: CAN SOMEONE DENIAL SENDING A MESSAGE?
AUTHENTICATION: BEING ABLE TO CONFIRM HAVING RIGHTFUL ACCESS TO THE ASSET
AUTHORIZATION: UPON AUTHENTICATION, BEING ABLE TO HAVE NO MORE AND NO LESS PERMISSION TO ALTER THE ASSET
HOWEVER, THESE ARE STILL NOT BUSINESS-ORIENTED, FOR THIS `SABSA' IS MORE FIT

DEFENSE IN DEPTH-CONCEPT IS ADDING LAYERS OF SECURITY:
PREVENTION
DETECTION
RESPOND/RECOVER

CRYPTON AND ENCRYPTR ARE SERVICES THAT HAVE ZERO KNOWLEDGE ON THE THINGS THEY ENCRYPT FOR THEIR CLIENTS
