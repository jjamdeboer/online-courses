HACKING IS VALUABLE FOR (AMONGST OTHERS):
- USING THE HACKED DEVICE AS A WEB SERVER
- USING IT AS A BOT
- OBTAINING CREDENTIALS FROM THE DEVICE (FOR LOGGING IN INTO VALUABLE SERVICES OR DO REPUTATION DAMAGE)
- ENCRYPTING IT AND DEMAND HOSTAGE MONEY
- USING IT TO SELL GOODS (SPECIFIC KIND OF WEB SERVER)

BEST WAYS FOR KEEPING SAFE:
- UPDATE SYSTEM
- USE STRONG PASSWORDS
- MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
- DON'T SHARE INFORMATION LIGHTLY

COMPLEXITY IS ADVERSARY WITH RESPECT TO SECURITY, SINCE THE THREAD SURFACE ENLARGES
FOR THIS REASON, SECURITY IS BECOMING WORSE THAN BEFORE, SINCE SYSTEMS ARE BUILDING TOWARDS THE COMPLEX

SECURITY BUG == VULNERABILITY
BUGS CAN BE PRESENT IN PERSONAL SOFTWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, FIRMWARE, HOSTING SITES, BROWSER (EXTENSION), WEBPAGES OR IN AN ONLINE SERVICE
CVE DETAILS (www.cvedetails.com) IS A WEBPAGE THAT CONTAINS INFORMATION ON ALL KNOWN BUGS (EVEN ATTACHING SCORES TO IT)
ANOTHER ONE (LOCAL PROGRAM) IS THE EXPLOIT KIT LANDSCAPE MAP GIVES MORE INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS/KITS
ANOTHER ONE IS THE EXPLOIT DATABASE (www.exploit-db.com) WHICH CONTAINS THE ACTUAL CODE OF THE KITS; LOCAL COPIES ARE CREATED WITH THE PROGRAM SEARCHSPLOIT, INCLUDED IN LINUX KALI
EXPLOIT KITS ARE GETTING LESS POPULAR, SINCE SOCIAL ENGINEERING IS EASIER AND MORE PROFITABLE

THE LESS TALENTED HACKERS ARE CALLED SCRIPT KITTIES, SINCE ALL THEY DO IS RUN SCRIPTS OTHER PEOPLE CREATED
THE TALENTED PEOPLE CREATE THE SCRIPTS OR EVEN HACKING-AS-A-SERVICE (HAAS)
THE SCRIPT KITTIES ARE THE EXECUTING FORCE AND THE TALENTED HACKERS THE CREATIVE FORCE

MALWARE/POTENTIALLY UNWANTED PROGRAMS (PUPS) CAN BE DIVIDED INTO:
- MACRO VIRUSES: WRITTEN IN, E.G., VBS AND WILL RUN IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN EXCEL IS STARTED; CAN BE WRITTEN FOR ANYTHING THAT ALLOWS MACROS
- STEALTH VIRUSES: MODIFIES INFORMATION ON THE SYSTEM IT IS IMPLEMENTED ON, SPECIFICALLY TO CONFUSE THE OPERATING SYSTEM/ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE
- POLYMORPHIC VIRUSES: COPIES AND MODIFIES ITSELF
- SELF-GARBLING VIRUSES: MODIFIES ITSELF TO REMAIN UNDETECTABLE
- BOTS/ZOMBIES: DEVICES THAT ARE UNDER COMMAND OF A MALICIOUS ACTOR
- WORMS: SIMPLY SPREAD, DO NOTHING IN PARTICULAR
- OS ROOTKITS: IN THE ROOT OF THE OS AND THEREFORE OFTEN COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE; CAN BE OF THE OTHER SPECIES ABOVE; WORST KIND OF VIRUS; FIRMWARE ROOTKITS ARE A SPECIFIC TYPE
- KEY LOGGERS: LOGS KEYSTROKES
- TROJANS: APPEAR TO BE ONE TYPE OF PROGRAM BUT ARE SOMETHING ELSE IN THE BACKGROUND
- REMOTE ACCESS TOOLS (RAT): GIVE COMPLETE ACCESS TO A DEVICE (HAVIKS, ALIENSPY, COMRATS ARE SOME EXAMPLES)
- RANSOMWARE: ENCRYPT PERSONAL FILES (WERNER, WANNACRY ARE SOME EXAMPLES)
- MALVERTISEMENT: ADVERTISEMENT THAT IS INFECTED WITH SOME VIRUS (IF PEOPLE OPEN IT OR CLICK ON IT)
- DRIVE-BY MALWARE: INFECTION OCCURS SIMPLY BY VISITING A SITE (CAN HAPPEN VIA MALVERTISEMENT OR A COMPROMISED OR SIMPLY MALICIOUS WEBSITE)
- SPYWARE: GATHERS DATA; INTELLIGENCE GATHERING MALWARE
- ADWARE: FORCES ADS ON YOU (OFTEN VIA BROWSER HIJACKING; SOME DEVICES HAVE ADWARE PRE-INSTALLED LIKE ANDROID PHONES)
- SCAREWARE: FAKE SECURITY UPDATES THAT URGES ONE TO TAKE ACTION BECAUSE A VULERNABILITY HAS BEEN DETECTED
- CRYPTO MINERS: HACKS A DEVICE AS A MEANS FOR ADDITIONAL CPU/GPU FOR BITCOIN-MINING

SOCIAL ENGINEERING CAN BE DIVIDED INTO:
- PHISHING: PERSUADE SOMEONE TO CLICK ON MANIPULATED LINKS AND/OR URL REDIRECTIONS ON A LEGITIMATE SITE (VIA SCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION E.G., SEE BELOW) 
    - THIS SO THAT A PERSON PUT CREDENTIALS IN A FIELD ONLINE, E.G. 
    - NORMALLY THIS IS DONE EN MASSE, WHEN TARGETED INDIVIDUALLY, IT IS SPEAR PHISHING
    - SOME WEBSITES ALLOW FOR SCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION IN EITHER THE URL OR ON THE WEBSITE ITSELF VIA ADVERTISEMENT; BEING ABLE TO EXECUTE SCRIPTS AT THE VERY LEAST LEADS TO KEYLOGGING
    - VISHING/SMHISHING: PHISHING VIA VOICE/PHONE AND SMS RESPECTIVELY
- SPAM: UNSOLICITATED MESSAGES; COULD BE CONTAINING PHISHING OR ADS OR OTHER MALWARE
- DOXING: SHORT FOR DOCUMENTING IS (PUBLICLY) SHARING PERSONAL/PRIVATE INFORMATION TO EMBARASS OR ENDANGER A PERSON/ORGANIZATION/COMPANY
- SCAMS: SIMPLE (NO PRODUCT BUT ONE SENDS A CHECK ANYWAY); COUNTERFEIT (FAKE PRODUCT IS BOUGHT INSTEAD OF A-BRAND); EMPTY BOX (SELLER CLAIMS IT MUST HAVE BEEN STOLEN UNDERWAY AND THAT'S NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY); CREDIT CARD (ADDITIONAL CREDIT CARD CHARGES THAT ARE NONSENSE); SUBSCRIPTION OR RECURRING CHARGES; COMBINATIONS THEREOF; COMPUTER FIX (SOMEONE CONTACTS TO REPAIR COMPUTER, EITHER ONLINE OR FOR A FEE AT YOUR PLACE); FINANCIAL AID (PROMISES FINANCIAL ADVICE); ONLINE DATING (PEOPLE POSE/CATFISH AND ASK FOR MONEY)

A DARK NET IS ANY KIND OF ENCRYPTED/INTERNAL NETWORK THAT ONE CAN ONLY ACCESS WITH RIGHT SOFTWARE OR CREDENTIALS; NORMAL INTERNET IS ALSO CALLED CLEARNET AS A CONTRAST
DARK NETS ARE FOR ANONYMITY AND SOMETIMES ENSURE SECURITY
EXAMPLES:
- RETROSHARE: PEER-TO-PEER FILE-SHARING OR CHATTING NETWORK
- TOR/ONION SITES
- I2P ANONYMOUS: LIKE TOR, LESS POPULAR
- GNUNET-FRAMEWORK: IDEM
- FREENET-PROJECT: CAN BE USED FOR BROWSING, FILESHARING, CHATTING

THROUGH THE DARKNET ONE CAN ENTER HACKER FORUMS AND DARK MARKETS WHERE, AMONG ELSE, ILLEGAL THINGS CAN BE PURCHASED
EXAMPLES OF DARK MARKETS CAN BE SEEN ON THE SITE www.deepdotweb.com; ALL LINKS ARE ONION-SITES

ACTIVE AND MASS SURVEILLANCE ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN MOST/ALL COUNTRIES
IN ORDER NOT TO BREAK DOMESTIC LAWS, COUNTRIES REQUEST OTHER COUNTRIES TO SPY ON THEIR CITIZENS AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION (E.G. THE FIVE EYES AGREEMENT BETWEEN AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, CANADA, UK, USA; NINE EYES ADD DENMARK, NETHERLANDS, FRANCE AND NORWAY; FOURTEEN EYES FURTHERMORE ADDS BELGIUM, GERMANY, SPAIN, ITALY AND SWEDEN)
MILLIONS IS SPENT TO MONITOR INFORMATION THAT IS SHARED ONLINE, THIS INCLUDES: TRACKING LOCATION, SWITCHING ON MICROPHONES/CAMERAS, CHANGE WEB CONTENT
CONTRARY TO MASS SURVEILLANCE IS ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE/HACKING
SOFTWARE FOR ACTIVE OR PASSING HACKING ARE SOLD BY COMPANIES TO GOVERNMENTS OR ARE DEVELOPED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
INTERDICTION IS PROCESS OF INSTALLING MALICIOUS HARDWARE INTO CONSUMER/GOVERNMENT HARDWARE; SPECIFIC INTERDICTION IS RARE, BUT GENERAL INTERDICTION IS MOST COMMON
NSA MEANS CAN BE SEEN IN THE FILE NSA ANT PRODUCT CATALOG, NOW CIRCLING PUBLICLY ONLINE AFTER SNOWDEN REVELATIONS
THROUGH A PRISM - DARKLY IS A VIDEO THAT GIVES MORE DETAILS ON NSA SPYING PRACTICES; ALSO WIKILEAKS ARE A GOOD RESOURCE AS IS THE INTERCEPT
GOVERNMENTS OFTEN PUSH FOR WEAKENING SECURITY MEASURES (MANDATING SECURITY WEAKENING) WHILST IMPROVING SPYING CAPABILITIES
KEYS UNDER THE DOORMAT: MANDATING INSECURITY BY REQUIRING GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO ALL DATA AND COMMUNICATION + THE CASE AGAINST REGULATING ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY + NINE EPIC FAILURES OF REGULATING CRYPTOGRAPHY ARE ARTICLES ABOUT SECURITY WEAKENING BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
ONE MITIGATING FACTOR FOR WEAK SECURITY IS REPRODUCIBLE BUILDS: MULTIPLE PARTIES BUILD THE SAME SOURCE CODE TO BINARY CODE, THE GUARANTEE THAT THE BINARIES ARE SAFE
