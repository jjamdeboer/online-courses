THE SITE tosdr.org IS A HELPFUL AID IN INVESTIGATING WHETHER TERMS AND SERVICES OF A WEBSITE ARE IN ORDER OR BREACHING ANONOMITY/PRIVACY TO A LARGE DEGREE

AVOIDANCE: AVOIDING HAVING COMPROMISING SERVICES IN THE FIRST PLACE
COMPARTMENTALIZATION: HAVING ACCOUNTS THAT ARE NOT LINKED (NO LINKED INFORMATION, USING ALIASES, ETC.)
CONTENT: HEAVILY CURATE THE CONTENT ONE REVEALS ONLINE, DEFINITELY BETWEEN MULTIPLE PLATFORMS THAT MIGHT BE CONNECTED -- DISADVANTAGE IS THAT TERMS OF SERVICES MIGHT STILL REVEAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
AUDIENCE: CURATE CONTENT BASED ON AUDIENCE -- RISKY, SINCE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SOMETIMES USED FOR PROFESSIONAL FILTERING
OPEN: BEING OPEN AND AUTHENTIC ALWAYS EVERYWHERE ONLINE

THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE/DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT ARE MUCH LIKE FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN, ETC., BUT LESS COMPROMISED: DIASPORA, FRIENDICA AND GNU SOCIAL NETWORK
THERE IS ALSO 'PUBLIC USERS/USERNAMES' AVAILABLE SO THAT ONE DOESN'T NEED TO MAKE OWN ACCOUNT, THESE CAN BE FOUND ON: bugmenot.com
DISPOSABLE AND TEMPORARY EMAIL ACCOUNTS ARE ALSO AN OPTION, BUT THESE ARE NOT PRIVATE, BUT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, EXAMPLES ARE: GUERILLAMAIL, MYTRASHMAIL, FREEMAIL, 10MINUTEMAIL, CRAPMAIL AND MANY MORE
THERE ARE ALSO SITES WHERE ONE CAN RECEIVE SMS MESSAGES WITHOUT A PHONE; EASILY SEARCHED

BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES IS THE FIRST STEP TO MITIGATE SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
    - IF NOT ORDERED/REQUESTED, DON'T CLICK/RESPOND
    - TRY TO AVOID DOWNLOADING AND EXECUTING FILES THAT ARE NOT COMPLETELY TRUSTED -- ESPECIALLY VIA LINKS OR EMAIL ATTACHMENTS
    - NEVER ENTER PERSONAL INFORMATION/LOGIN DETAILS AFTER FOLLOWING A LINK OR POPUP -- ALWAYS GO TO THE SITE YOURSELF
    - TRY TO VALIDATE THE LINK
    - MINIMISE THE DATA ONE LITTERS AROUND
    - VALIDATE THE SENDER, VIA OFFICIAL SITES OR VIA ANOTHER MEDIUM; ALSO SEEING WHETHER THE SITE/SENDER IS REGISTRED, WHETHER THE SITE HAS BEEN CLONED AND WHETHER LINKS ARE OPERATIONAL ARE INDICATORS
    - BE SUSPICUOUS OF ATTACHMENTS, ESPECIALLY EXECUTABLES OR FILES THAT CAN CONTAIN EXECUTABLES (LIKE COMPRESSED FILES, WORD, EXCEL, PDF)
SECOND STEP IS TECHNICAL/SECURITY CONTROLS:
    - USE SAFE EMAIL PROVIDER -- MOST EMAIL PROVIDERS SCAN CONTENT BECAUSE OF SPAM, WHICH IS A PRIVACY-CONCERN, BUT A SECURITY-CONTROL
    - TRY TO SCAN SOURCES AS RAW TEXT
    - USE UBLOCK ORIGIN
    - ISOLATION AND COMPARIMENTALISATION (LIKE QUBES AND DOCKER)/SANDBOXING: 
        - HARDWARE HAS UNIQUE SERIAL NUMBER, MAC-ADDRESS IS LIKE IP-ADDRESS FOR LOCAL NETWORK CARD (AND THEREFORE MACHINE/YOU IF NOT ANONYMOUSLY BOUGHT), SO IMPORTANT TO SCRAMBLE MAC-ADDRESS [FOR LINUX, USE TOOL macchanger TO CHANGE MAC-ADDRESS] 
        - MOTHERBOARDS OFTEN HAVE COMPONENTS WITH SERIAL NUMBERS, LIKE BIOS MEMORY [FOR LINUX ONE CAN USE TOOL dmidecode TO INSPECT SERIAL NUMBERS OF HARDWARE COMPONENTS] WHICH ADVERSARIES CAN OBTAIN PHYSICALLY OR VIA SOFTWARE; DUAL BOOTS ARE GENERALLY NOT SUPERSAFE, DUE TO THE HARDWARE SERIALS
        - NETWORK ISOLATION IS A GREAT IDEA FOR HAVING UNTRUSTED DEVICES AS A SEPARATE ENTITY, ALSO BETWEEN HOST AND GUEST SYSTEMS, LIKE HOST OS AND THE CONTAINERS IT HOLDS
        - SANDBOXES ARE GENERALLY BUILT AROUND APPLICATIONS, BUT WORKAROUNDS ARE ALSO SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE STANDARD SANDBOXES, SO ADDITIONAL SANDBOXES MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A GOOD IDEA [FOR LINUX USE apparmor; trustedbsd FOR BSD]
        - MINIMISE SHARING OF RESOURCES/HARDWARE/NETWORKS, ETC. BETWEEN HOSTS AND CONTAINERS/VIRTUAL MACHINES WHEREVER POSSIBLE, FOR OPTIMAL ANONYMITY
    - USE OPENPGP TO VALIDATE SENDER
    - HOST FILES WITH LINKS RATHER THAN ATTACHMENTS
    - USE ANTI-VIRUS AND FIREWALLS
    - ENCRYPT YOUR DISKS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS

IN MOST LINUX-SYSTEMS, THE KERNEL INCLUDES, IN FACT, MANY PROGRAMS, LIKE VIRTUAL MEMORY, FILE SYSTEM, SYSTEM CALL, DEVICE DRIVERS AND OTHERS
IN QUBESOS, A MICROKERNEL IS USED, SO THE KERNEL IS GREATLY REDUCED AND MANY COMPONENTS (APPLICATIONS, UNIX SERVER, DEVICE DRIVER, FILER SERVER) ARE MADE INTO OWN USERS WITH REDUCED AUTHORITY
COMBINATION OF QUBES WITH WHONIX PROVIDES COMPARTMENTALIZATION TOGETHER WITH ANONYMITY, WHICH ADDS MULTIPLE LAYERS OF SECURITY
