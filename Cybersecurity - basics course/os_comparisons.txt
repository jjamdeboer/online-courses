LINUX: MOST SECURE, KUBEOS/TAILS/ARCH ARE EXTREMELY SECURE
WINDOWS: BAD TRACK RECORD, BUT MOST RECENT VERSIONS HAVE MANY SECURITY FEATURES AND PROGRAMS AVAILABLE; DOES COMPROMISE PERSONAL DATA/TRACKING FOR SPAMMING/ADS
MAC: HAS BETTER RECORD, BUT HAS ACTUALLY MUCH LESS SECURITY FEATURES AND PROGRAMS AVAILABLE

WINDOWS HAS MOST WINDOWS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES (AS OF svedetails.com), THEN MAC (ALTHOUGH GOOGLE HAS MANY SECURITY ISSUES TOO)
HOWEVER, THERE ARE SERIOUS BIASES IN HOW THE DATA IS CREATED, AS BUG BOUNTIES ONLY APPLY TO CLOSED-SOURCE-SOFTWARE AND POPULAR DISTROS ARE MORE OFTEN CHECKED

WINDOWS ACTUALLY REVERTS YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS WHEN IT UPDATES, MEANING ONE SHOULD REGULARLY CHECK IF THEY ARE STILL VALID
WINDOWS AND MAC ARE OK FOR SECURITY, BUT VERY WEAK FOR PRIVACY
SECURITY:
    - QUBES IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CHOICE FOR SECURITY-FOCUSED OPERATING SYSTEMS
    - OTHERS ARE: SUBGRAPH, TRISQUEL, HARDENED GENTOO, PUREOS, ASTRA LINUX, SELINUX
ANONIMITY:
    - TAILS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CHOICE FOR ANONOMITY-FOCUSED OPERATING SYSTEMS, HOWEVER, GOVERNMENTS WILL DEFINITELY ATTACK THIS DISTRO, SINCE IT IS THE WEAPON OF CHOICE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES
    - WHONIX IS ANOTHER GOOD ONE
YOU COULD COMBINE QUBES WITH A WHONIX COMPARTMENT/CUBE TO MAKE A SECURE AND ANONYMOUS DEVICE
PENTESTING AND ETHICAL HACKING:
    - KALI LINUX IS THE MOST WELL-KNOWN AND BEST
    - PARROT OS IS ANOTHER GOOD ONE FOR CLOUD-TESTING AND IOT-TESTING
    - BLACKARCH, BLACKBOX AND PENTOO ARE OTHER ONES
MOBILE:
    - SECURITY IS QUITE GOOD WITH IOS, LESS SO WITH ANDROID
    - LINEAGEOS (ANDROID-BASED), SAILFISH-OS, REPLICANT (ANDROID-BASED), OMNIROM (ANDROID-BASED), MICROG (GOOGLE-ANDRIOD-BASED), PUREOS ARE BETTER FOR PRIVACY AND ANONOMITY
