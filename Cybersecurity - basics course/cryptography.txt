SINCE ENCRYPTION IS OFTEN ONE OF THE STRONGEST LINKS IN THE SYSTEM, IN IT IS SELDOMLY DIRECTLY ATTACKED -- RATHER, THE HUMAN FACTORS ARE MUCH MORE OFTEN EXPLOITED

ENCYPTION-DECRYPTION MOST OFTEN USED CRYPTOGRAPHY-TECHNIQUE
ENCRYPTION TURNS VALUABLE THINGS INTO GARBAGE (CIPHER TEXT), WHICH CAN THEN BE MADE AVAILABLE VIA DECRYPTION
THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS: THE ALGORITHM AND THE KEY WITH WHICH TO DECRYPT/ENCRYPT
TRADITIONALLY: ALGORITHM PUBLIC AND KEY(S) SECRET
SYMMETRIC ALGORITHMS USE ONE KEY
    - THE NUMBER FOR THE ENCRYPTION/ALGORITHM, GENERALLY REFERS TO THE LENGTH OF THE KEY; THIS HIGHER MAKES THE ALGORITHM STRONGER, YET SLOWER
    - BRUTE-FORCING THE KEY IS SIMPLY TRYING OUT WHICH PASSWORD GENERATES THE DESIRED KEY
ASYMMETRIC ALGORITHMS USE TWO KEYS: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
    - ONE CAN BE USED TO ENCRYPT ONE TO DECRYPT, WHICH ONE FOR WHAT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT IT IS THE CONJUGATE KEY THAT DOES THE REVERSE ACTION
    - IF ENCRYPTION IS DONE WITH PUBLIC, AUTHENTICATION IS NOT OF INTEREST, CONFIDENTIALITY IS
    - IF ENCRYPTION IS DONE WITH PRIVATE, AUTHENTICATION IS OF INTEREST, CONFIDENTIALITY ISN'T (SINCE EVERYONE CAN DECRYPT IT)
SYMMETRIC IS FASTER AND STRONGER, ASYMMETRIC IS BETTER SCALABLE AND NON-REPUDIATE (MEANING CAN'T DENIAL ONE'S ACTIONS)
OFTEN ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION IS USED TO DISTRIBUTE SYMMETRIC KEYS, GIVING BEST OF BOTH

ONE-SIDED ENCRYPTION SUPRISINGLY OFTEN USED AS HASHING	
HASH FUNCTIONS HAVE ANY DATA AS INPUT AND RETURN FIXED LENGTH DATA AS OUTPUT (WHICH LENGTH IS DESCRIBED BY NUMBER IN THE NAME OF ALGORITHM)
HASH FUNCTIONS NEVER HAVE A REVERSE OPERATION, IT IS IN THAT SENSE NO KEY(-OPERATION)
HASH FUNCTION VERIFY INTEGRITY (NO ALTERCATION), SINCE HASHES CAN BE COMPARED. IT DOES NOT PROVIDE AUTHENTICATION OR INTENTIONAL MODIFICATION (IF THE WHOLE SOURCE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED, E.G.)

DIGITALLY SIGNATURES ARE COMBINATION OF ASYMMETRIC KEYS AND HASHING, BY HASHING THE PRIVATE KEY IN A MESSAGE, FOR AUTHENTICATION
THIS COMBINATION OF FIRST ENCRYPTING MESSAGE WITH PRIVATE AND THEN HASHING THE PRIVATE KEY, PROVIDES AUTHENTICATION (SINCE ONLY PERSON HAVING THAT KEY COULD HAVE ENCRYPTED THAT MESSAGE AND THEN HASHED THAT KEY), NONREPUDIATION (SINCE CAN'T DENY SENDING THAT MESSAGE IF IT WAS REALLY YOU) AND INTEGRITY (NO ONE ALTERED THAT MESSAGED)
THEREFORE, DECRYPTION CAN BE DONE WITH PUBLIC KEY AND THEN HASHES CAN BE COMPARED SOMEWHERE
DIGITAL CERTIFICATES ARE FOR AUTHENICATING PUBLIC KEYS; THE DIGITAL CERTIFICATE IS STORED BY A TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY
YOUR BROWSER CONTAINS A LIST OF ROOT CERTIFICATES OF THIRD PARTIES THAT CAN BE TRUSTED (NO, REALLY)
HOWEVER, TRUSTED PARTIES CAN ALWAYS BE COMPROMISED AT ONE POINT
COUNTRIES HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE ON THESE TRUSTED THIRD-PARTIES, SO THAT THEY OFTEN HAVE PRIVATE KEYS IN THE COMMUNICATION

SECURE SOCKETS LAYER (SSL) AND TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY (TLS) USE COMBINATIONS OF PREVIOUS TECHNIQUES
SSL IS INSECURE, TLS IS BETTER; BOTH ARE REFERRED TO AS 'SSL', WHICH CAN BE CONFUSING
KEYS ARE SYMMETRICALLY GENERATED FOR EACH CONNECTION (WHICH IS DETERMINED AT START OF SESSION); AUTHENTICATION IS THEN DONE WITH ASYMMETRIC KEYS AND DIGITAL SIGNATURES; MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE (MAC) IS THEN USED TO VERIFY INTEGRITY OF THE MESSAGE
SO: ENCRYPTING DATA, EXCHANGING KEYS AND AUTHENTICATING IDENTITIES

MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE-ATTACKS ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT, BUT SOMETIMES DONE WITH COMPROMISED HARDWARE SUCH AS ROUTERS
TUNNELING (LIKE VPN OR SSH) IS A GREAT WAY OF CIRCUMVENTING THESE ATTACKS
HTTP IS IN PLAIN TEXT SO REALLY WORTH THE EFFORT OF DOING THIS; HTTPS NO LONGER IS -- THIS IS ENCRYPTED

END-TO-END-ENCRYPTION (E2EE) IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LINES OF DEFENSES
ZERO-KNOWLEDGE E2EE MEANS THAT IF THE SERVICE PROVIDER IS COMPROMISED, YOUR COMMUNICATION IS STILL SAFE -- SOME CHAT-PROGRAMS GUARANTEE THIS (SIGNAL AND CRYPTO-CAT)

THERE IS ANOTHER TECHNIQUE CALLED HIDDING DATA IN PLAIN SIGHT (STEGANOGRAPHY), WHICH CONCEALS DATA BY MIXING IT WITH DATA THAT IS VERY MUCH PUBLIC (LIKE A MEME)
THE SECRET DATA IS NOT ENCRYPTED AT ALL IN THIS CASE
