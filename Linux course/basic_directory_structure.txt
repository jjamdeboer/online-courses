DIRECTORY SYSTEM:

FOLDER AND DIRECTORY IS THE SAME THING.

THE ROOT DIRECTORY IS THE BASIS OF THE FILE SYSTEM, SYMBOLIZED BY '/' (THAT MEANS: cd / GOES TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY, WHEREVER YOU ARE IN YOUR LINUX SYSTEM).

THE /bin-DIRECTORY CONTAINS THE (MACHINE-READABLE) BINARY-FILES. SOURCE CODE (HUMAN-READABLE) IS COMPILED AND TRANSLATED TO BINARY CODE AND PLACED INSIDE THAT DIRECTORY.

THE CONFIGURATION FILES ARE LOCATED INSIDE THE /etc-DIRECTORY. THESE FILES DECIDE THE CONFIGURATION FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM (E.G.: TO BOOT IN GRAPHICAL MODE OR TEXT MODE)

THE /home-DIRECTORY (ALSO: ~) IS WHERE THE (MULTIPLE) USERS AND ALL THEIR DATA ARE LOCATED.

THE /opt-DIRECTORY IS WHERE THE OPTIONAL OR THIRD-PARTY-SOFTWARE IS LOCATED (E.G.: GOOGLE EARTH IS NOT STANDARD IN ANY LINUX DISTRIBUTION, IS LOCATED HERE WHEN INSTALLED). OFTEN THIS SOFTWARE IS ALSO LOCATED IN /usr/local.

THE /temp-DIRECTORY IS WHERE TEMPORARY FILES ARE LOCATED. FOR MOST DISTRIBUTIONS THESE FILES WILL BE LOST WHEN THE SYSTEM IS REBOOTED.

THE /usr-DIRECTORY IS WHERE USER-RELATED PROGRAMS ARE (E.G.: PYTHON VERSION 3.6). THE /usr-DIRECTORY ALSO CONTAINS MOST THE DIRECTORIES LISTED HERE, SINCE THEY ARE RELEVANT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL USER.

THE /var-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE VARIABLE DATA IS LOCATED (E.G.: HOW A PROGRAM IS PERFORMING). USUALLY LOG-FILES.

THE /boot-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE FILES ARE THAT ARE NEEDED FOR BOOTING THE SYSTEM.

THE /cdrom-DIRECTORY OR /media-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE FILES ARE LOCATED THAT HELP MOUNTING A CD-ROM (OR OTHER MEDIA, IN CASE OF media). ACCESS POINT TO THE CONTENT OF THE CD-ROM (IDEM).

THE /dev-DIRECTORY CONTAINS DEVICE FILES (SPECIFICATIONS OF THE DEVICE THAT IS USED).

THE /etc-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FILES ARE LOCATED (WHAT SOFTWARE IS NEEDED FOR WHAT HARDWARE).

THE /export-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE SHARED FILES SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED (IN CASE OF INTERNAL NETWORK).

THE /lib-DIRECTORY AND /lib64-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE SYSTEM LIBRARIES ARE LOCATED (SOFTWARE THAT IS PRE-WRITTEN FOR THE HARDWARE; 64-BIT IN CASE OF lib64).

THE /lost+found-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE FILES ARE THAT ARE RECOVERED AFTER A FILE SYSTEM CHECK WAS PERFORMED.

THE /mnt-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE EXTERNAL FILE SYSTEMS ARE MOUNTED (IN CASE OF AN INTERNAL NETWORK).

THE /proc-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE INFORMATION ON THE RUNNING PROCESSES IS LOCATED.

THE /sbin-DIRECTORY IS WHERE THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION BINARIES ARE LOCATED (PROTECTED/SEPARATE FROM OTHER BINARY-FILES).

THE /selinux-DIRECTORY (SECURITY ENHANCED LINUX) IS WHERE ALL THE FILES ON SECURITY AND ACCESS OF FILES IS LOCATED.

THE /srv-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE FILES ARE LOCATED THAT ARE SERVED BY THE SYSTEM (SUCH AS WEB PAGES).

THE /sys-DIRECTORY IS WHERE ALL THE FILES ARE LOCATED THAT CONTAINS INFORMATION ON HOW TO DISPLAY AND (SOMETIMES HOW TO) CONFIGURE DEVICES KNOWN TO LINUX KERNEL

_______________________________________________________________________
SHELL:

THE LINUX SHELL IS WHEN YOU START THE COMPUTER IN TEXT-MODE, WHEN YOU INTERACT (WITH SSH) WITH A LINUX SERVER OR WHEN YOU ARE IN GRAPHICAL MODE AND PRESS CTRL+ALT+T (STARTS A TERMINAL EMULATOR PROGRAM TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SHELL).

THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE IN LINUX IS CALLED THE GRAPHICAL SHELL. HOWEVER 'SHELL' REFERS TO COMMAND LINE INTERFACE. THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE IS ALWAYS THERE, IN ANY DISTRIBUTION.

THE SHELL PROMPT IS SHOWN WHEN THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE IS OPENED. IT OFTEN SHOWS THE CURRENT SYSTEM (jelmertp@jelmertp) AND CURRENT DIRECTORY YOU ARE IN. IT ALSO SHOWS WHETHER A NORMAL USER (THEN LINE ENDS WITH '$') OR SUPERUSER ("" '#') IS USING THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE.

ROOT CAN MEAN EITHER THE ROOT OF THE DIRECTORY FILE SYSTEM, OR THE SUPERUSER, WHICH IS ALSO CALLED ROOT.

THE SHELL CAN BE CUSTOMIZED. FOR A BASH SHELL USE THE 'PS1' VARIABLE FOR BASH AND CHANGE THE ~/.bash_profile FILE FOR PERSISTENT CHANGES.

USEFUL COMMANDS:
cd (CHANGE DIRECTORY) [- (CHANGE TO PREVIOUS DIRECTORY)]
ls (LIST DIRECTORY CONTENT) [-l (MORE INFORMATION: PERMISSION; NUMBER OF LINKS TO THE FILE; OWNER NAME; GROUP NAME; SIZE IN NUMBER OF BYTES; LAST MODIFICATION TIME; FILE NAME) -a (SHOWS ALSO HIDDEN FILES)] [-F (SHOWS FILE TYPES: '/' FOR DIRECTORIES, '@' FOR LINK/POINTER, '*' FOR EXECUTABLE)] [-t (SORT BY TIME)] [-r (REVERSE ORDER OF SHOWING)] [-R (SHOWS ALSO THE CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORIES)]
tree [directory] (SHOWS THE CONTENT OF ALL THE CHILDREN FILES AND DIRECTORIES) [-d (SHOW ONLY DIRECTORIES)]
pwd (SHOWING CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY)
cat (CONCATENATE AND DISPLAYS FILES) [file1 ... fileX (ONLY SHOWS) > output_file (CONCATENATES THE FILES AND PUTS THE CONCATENATED FILES IN OUTPUT-FILE)] [> (SIGNIFIES: WRITE IN THIS FILE)] [>> APPENDS FILE TO ANOTHER FILE]
echo [$VAR_NAME] (DISPLAYS ARGUMENTS TO THE PROMPT: PRINTS CONTENT OF VARIABLE TO PROMPT) [$OLDPWD (SHOWS PREVIOUS DIRECTORY)]
man [command] (DISPLAYS MANUAL FOR THAT COMMAND) [-k search_word (GIVES SUGGESTIONS FOR COMMAND USING THAT SEARCH TERM)]
exit (EXITS SHELL OR CURRENT SESSION)
clear (CLEARS THE SCREEN)
which [command] (SHOWS WHICH COMMAND IS USED WHEN THIS COMMAND IS PUT IN PROMPT)
mkdir [directory_name] [p directory1/directory2/directory3 (CREATES ALL THOSE DIRECTORIES)]
[command_one] '|' [command_two] (PIPE OPERATOR, FEEDS OUTPUT OF FIRST COMMAND TO SECOND COMMAND)
tr ["character_one" "character_two"] (TURNS character_one INTO character_two IN A LINE OF TEXT)
--help OR -h OR man FOR EXTRA HELP ON COMMANDS
THE 'PATH'-VARIABLE DETERMINES WHICH COMMAND TO USE. TO EXECUTE LOCAL COMMAND:
./[COMMAND] (EXECUTES COMMAND IN CURRENT DIRECTORY)
[PATH TO COMMAND] (EXECUTES COMMAND IN PATH)
MORE OPTIONS FOR A COMMAND CAN BE COMBINED: [command] -option_one -option_two = [command] -option_oneoption_two

ONE CAN USE ALIASES FOR LONG AND REPETITIVE COMMANDS:
alias (LIST CURRENT ALIASES)
alias [name [= 'value'] ] (CREATE ALIAS)
unalias [name] (REMOVES ALIAS name)
unalias -a (REMOVES ALL ALIASES)
FOR PERSISTENT ALIASES EDIT THE .bash_profile FILE
