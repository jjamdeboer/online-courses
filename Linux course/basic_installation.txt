LINUX CAN REFER TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM, OR TO THE KERNEL, WHICH IS THE INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
TO MAKE A USEFUL OPERATING SYSTEM, A KERNEL NEEDS SYSTEM LIBRARIES AND GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES AS WELL (AMONG OTHERS)

LINUS TORVALS CREATED LINUX IN 1991 WHILE AT THE HELSINKI UNIVERSITY. HE GOT A IBM COMPUTER WITH MS-DOS, AND WANTED TO HAVE A COMPUTER WITH UNIX. HOWEVER, A UNIX COMPUTER WAS REALLY EXPENSIVE AT THE TIME, SO HE WANTED TO RUN UNIX ON HIS OWN COMPUTER. THE FIRST VERSION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1994. IT IS A FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (FOSS)-PROJECT. THIS LED TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS/DISTRIBUTIONS OF LINUX. THE SOURCE CODE REMAINS FREE (IT'S A DEMAND FROM LINUS), BUT YOU MIGHT NEED TO PAY TO USE THE DISTRIBUTION (E.G.: RED HAT LINUX). LINUX IS NOT BUILD ON UNIX, BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN FROM SCRATCH. HOWEVER IT IS BASED ON UNIX.

A LINUX DISTRIBUTION/FLAVOR IS A KERNEL + ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE (CURATED SET OF SOFTWARE). EACH DISTRIBUTION HAS OWN GOALS AND AREAS OF FOCUS (RESEARCH AND SCIENCE, SERVER, ...). LIST OF DISTRIBUTIONS CAN BE FOUND ON distrowatch.com.

THE REASON TO CHOOSE LINUX IS THAT IT CAN RUN ON ALMOST ANY PIECE OF HARDWARE, CONTARY TO OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. IT ALSO IS QUITE SMALL, WHICH MAKES IT USEFUL FOR OLD OR SMALL HARDWARE SYSTEMS. BESIDES, IT IS KNOWN FOR BEING RELATIVELY STABLE, RELIABLE AND SECURE. FOR THIS REASON LINUX IS OFTEN THE CHOICE FOR SERVERS.

WHEN CONNECTING TO A LINUX COMPUTER/VIRTUAL MACHINE OVER A NETWORK, YOU USE SECURE SHELL (SSH) FOR LINUX AND MAC, PUTTY FOR WINDOWS. TELNET USED TO BE COMMON, NOWADAYS NOT USED ANYMORE, BUT CAN BE USEFUL FOR OLD SYSTEMS. TO ENTER A LINUX COMPUTER WITH SSH:
ssh [SERVERNAME OR IP-ADDRESS OF SERVER]
OR:
ssh [USERNAME]@[SERVERNAME OR IP-ADDRESS OF SERVER]
RECOMMENDED IS TO USE VIRTUALBOX FOR A VIRTUAL MACHINE, NOT TO USE SSH.
