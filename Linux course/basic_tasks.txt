ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE PREDEFINED NAME-VALUE PAIRS (DICTIONARY), TO LIST THEM:
printenv 
printenv [name_variable]
OR:
echo [$name_variable]
CREATING/UPDATING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
export [name_variable]=[value]
IN WHICH value THAT ARE STRINGS ALWAYS NEED TO BE SURROUNDED BY QUOTATION MARKS AND CONVENTION IS TO USE UPPERCASE LETTERS FOR name_variable. DO NOT PUT SPACES AROUND THE '=', THIS GIVES ERRORS
TO REMOVE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
unset [name_variable]
THESE ACTIONS ONLY AFFECT YOUR CURRENT SESSION. IN ORDER TO MAKE PERSISTENT CHANGES:
cat ~/.bash_profile
export/unset ETC.
TO LIST SHELL HISTORY (STORED IN ~/.bash_history):
history
TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF COMMANDS HELD IN THIS FILE, CHANGE THE VARIABLE:
HISTSIZE (E.G.: export HISTSIZE=[number])
TO REPEAT A COMMAND:
![number]/!!/![string] (REPEAT COMMAND WITH COMMAND LINE NUMBER number OR PREVIOUS COMMAND OR THE MOST RECENT COMMAND STARTING WITH THE TEXT string)
OR:
![number/!/string]:[number] (HERE ! IS THE SAME AS !!, THE COMMAND IS TAKING THE numberTH WORD FROM THAT COMMAND, STARTING FROM 0)
OR:
!^ (IS THE SAME AS !:1)
OR:
!$ (IS THE SAME AS !:[last_argument])
FOR SEARCHING PREVIOUS COMMANDS:
CTRL + R (THEN TYPE A LETTER, WHICH WILL SEARCH MOST RECENT COMMAND STARTING WITH THAT LETTER; TO SCROLL THROUGH THESE COMMANDS, REPEAT CTRL + R; TO EXECUTE USE 'ENTER' AND TO MODIFY IT, USE ARROW KEY TO NAVIGATE IN THE COMMAND; TO QUIT ENTER CTRL + G)

PROCESSES:
DISPLAY CURRENT PROCESSES OR JOBS:
ps [-e (EVERYTHING: SHOW ALL PROCESSES) [-f (FULL FORMAT LISTING)] [-u [username] (SHOWS PROCESSES OF SPECIFIC USER)] [-p [number] (SHOWS PROCESS WITH SPECIFIC PROCESS IDENTIFICATION NUMBER number)]]
pstree (SAME IN TREE FORMAT)
top/htop (INTERACTIVE PROCESS VIEWER)
jobs [%number (SPECIFIC PROCESS IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR JOB NUMBER number)]
BACKGROUND PROCESSES DO NOT INHIBIT OTHER PROCESSES, SUCH AS A SHELL TAKING MORE COMMANDS, BUT THEY STILL EXECUTE 
TO START A BACKGROUND PROCESS:
[command] &
TO KILL FOREGROUND PROCESS: 
CTRL + C
TO SUSPEND FOREGROUND PROCESS:
CTRL + Z
TO SEND TO THE BACKGROUND/FOREGROUND:
bg/fg
bg/fg [%number/number (EITHER SPECIFIC JOB NUMBER %number OR SPECIFIC PROCESS IDENTIFICATION NUMBER number)]
TO STOP PROCESS:
kill [-sig (SIGNAL WITH THE NUMBER OR NAME sig, SUCH AS THE DEFAULT TERM(INATE))] [%number/number (EITHER SPECIFIC JOB NUMBER %number OR SPECIFIC PROCESS IDENTIFICATION NUMBER number)]
TO LIST ALL THE SIGNALS THAT CAN BE USED BY kill:
kill -l

CRON: TIME-BASED TASK SCHEDULING SYSTEM. TO SCHEDULE SUCH A TASK:
crontab (OPENS CRONTAB, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE AND READ JOBS)
crontab [filename (IMPORT CRON JOBS FROM filename)] [-l (LIST ALL CRON JOBS)] [-e (EDIT CRON JOBS)] [-r (REMOVE ALL CRON JOBS)]
SUCH CRON TABLES CONSIST OF:
[minute (0-59) hour (0-23) day_of_month (1-31) month_of_year (1-12) day_of_week (0-6)] [command]
WHERE '*' INDICATE THAT THAT TIME SCALE IS NOT RELEVANT (E.G.: FOR A TASK SCHEDULED EVERY MONTH, YEAR IS NOT RELEVANT)

CHANGING USER:
su [username (IF NOT GIVEN, CHANGES TO ROOT ACCOUNT)]
TO EXECUTE A COMMAND AS IF ANOTHER USER:
su [username (IF NOT GIVEN, CHANGES TO ROOT ACCOUNT)] [-c [command] (COMMAND TO BE EXECUTED AS USER username)]
sudo [-u [username] (IF NOT GIVEN, EXECUTES AS ROOT ACCOUNT)] [command (COMMAND TO BE EXECUTED AS USER username)] [-l (LIST ALL AVAILABLE COMMANDS)] [-s (START SHELL AS username)]
ADVANTAGE OF sudo OVER su, IS THAT ONE DOES NOT NEED TO KNOW THE OTHER USER'S PASSWORD, BUT ONLY SOMEONE'S OWN PASSWORD
TO EDIT THE sudo-COMMAND:
[sudo] visudo
TO SEE WHICH USER YOU CURRENTLY ARE:
whoami
ENVIRONMENTS (AND ITS VARIABLES) PERSIST WHEN SWITCHING USER. TO SWITCH ENVIRONMENT:
su - [username (IF NOT GIVEN, CHANGES TO ROOT ACCOUNT)]

PACKAGES: LIST OF FILES
PACKAGE MANAGERS: MANAGES THE TOTAL LIST OF PACKAGES AND THE INSTALL, UPGRADES AND REMOVAL OF PACKAGES
EXAMPLES OF PACKAGE MANAGERS ARE RPM (COMMAND LINE: yum) OR DEB (COMMAND LINE (ADVANCED PACKAGING TOOL): apt-get/apt-cache) 
DATA/METADATA: DESCRIPTION, VERSION AND DEPENDENCIES OF THE PACKAGE
TO MANAGE PACKAGES:
[command_line_package_utility: yum/apt] install/rm/remove/purge [package] (INSTALLING/REMOVING PACKAGE package; FOR DELETING CONFIGURATION FILES AS WELL, USE purge) [-v (VERBOSE)] [-y (OMIT ANSWERING QUESTION)]
TO GET ALL COMMANDS AVAILABLE TO YOUR PACKAGE MANAGER:
[command_line_package_utility: yum/apt] -l
TO SEARCH FOR PACKAGE/STRING:
[command_line_package_utility: yum/apt] search [string]
TO GET ALL INSTALLED PACKAGES:
[package_manager: rpm/dpkg] -l
