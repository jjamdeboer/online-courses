THERE ARE FOUR SCENARIOS OF LOADING DATA IN HADOOP:
- DATA AT REST: DATA IN FILE OR DIRECTORY WITH NO PLANNED UPDATE ON THEM, AND CAN BE TRANSFERRED AS SUCH (HDFS COMMANDS OR BIGINSIGHTS CONSOLE)
- DATA AT MOTION: THESE DATA SOURCES ARE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED, SUCH AS DATA FROM A WEB SERVER OR DATABASE LOG (FLUME, JAVA MANAGEMENT EXTENSIONS)
- DATA FROM DATA WAREHOUSE OR RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS): DATA CAN BE EXPORTED AND IMPORTED INTO HADOOP (SQOOP, JAQL)

FLUME USES THREE TIERS:
- AGENT TIER IS INSTALLED AT THE SOURCES OF THE DATA
- DATA IS THEN SENT TO COLLECTOR TIER
- FINAL STORAGE TIER SUCH AS HDFS
FLUME USES PHYSICAL NODES, WHICH IS A SINGLE JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE ON A NODE (IN THEORY ONE NODE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE VIRTUAL MACHINES RUNNING, BUT USUALLY THIS IS ONE MACHINE)

APACHE SQOOP IS USED TO MOVE DATA TO/FROM FROM DATA WAREHOUSE OR RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS) INTO HADOOP
SQOOP HAS A COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE; IT ACCESSES THE DATABASE TO RETRIEVE THE SCHEMA AND THEN USES A MAPREDUCE TO MOVE DATA INTO HDFS: sqoop import/export
SQOOP CAN ALSO BE USED TO MOVE DATA IN/OUT OF HIVE OR HBASE
SQOOP HAS BASIC IMPORT (DATABASE -> HADOOP)/EXPORT (HADOOP -> DATABASE) STATEMENTS
SQOOP USED JDBC (STRING, USERNAME, PASSWORD REQUIRED) TO ACCESS DATABASES; COMPATIBLE WITH BIGINSIGHTS
SQOOP EXTRACTS (AND WRITES) DATA IN PARALLEL, WITH MULTIPLE NODES (DEFAULT FOR EXTRACTION IS FOUR)
SQOOP WORKS WITH PRIMARY KEY OF TABLE AND ASSUMES AN EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF THIS KEY FOR DIVIDING THE TABLE; IF ANOTHER COLUMN IS SELECTED TO SPLIT BY, SPECIFY THE PARAMETER 'split-by'
IF NOT ALL THE COLUMNS NEED TO BE IMPORTED, USE '--columns [COLUMN NAMES]'-ARGUMENT; IF NOT ALL THE ROWS ARE NEEDED, USE '--where [QUERY]'-ARGUMENT
BY DEFAULT, IMPORTS ARE TEXT-FILES, BUT BINARY- AND AVRO-FORMAT ARE ALLOWED
FOR EXPORTS, THE TARGET TABLE MUST ALREADY EXIST; DEFAULT IS INSERT (ROWS MUST ALREADY EXIST), UPDATE (MISSING ROWS ARE NOT INSERTED, BUT NO ERROR IS THROWN) AND UPSERT (MISSING ROWS ARE INSERTED) AND CALL (FIRST DATA IS PROCESSED BEFORE PUT INTO THE DATABASE) ARE ALLOWED AS WELL
SQOOP ASSUMES CSV-FILES, BOTH FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT
IF SQOOP INSERT ROW IN A TABLE, IT USES MULTI-ROW-INSERT OF 100 ROWS
