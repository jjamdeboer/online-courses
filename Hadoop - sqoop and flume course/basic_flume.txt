ANOTHER METHOD, NEXT TO SQOOP, OF MOVING DATA INTO HDFS IS FLUME (LAT: FLUMEN ~ RIVER)

IT'S A JOKE THAT FLUMES (RIVERS) ARE USED IN THE LOGGING INDUSTRY FOR TRANSPORTING WOOD OVER THE RIVERS; FLUME IS USED TO TRANSPORT WEB LOGS OR DATABASE LOGS FROM THE LOG FILE TO A CENTRAL REPOSITORY IN HDFS

FLUME IS BUILT UPON FLOWS OF DATA, WHERE THE DATA ITSELF IS NOT THE DESIRED OBJECT, BUT ITS LOG IS

FLUME WORKS WITH FLUME AGENTS: ONE STARTS WITH ONE AGENT WHERE THE DATA ORIGINATES, THE DATA THEN FLOWS THROUGH SEVERAL NODES THAT ARE CHAINED TOGETHER (HAS CONNECTED FLUME AGENTS)
EVERY AGENT HAS AT LEAST ONE SOURCE AND ONE SINK, CONNECTED TOGETHER BY CHANNELS; EACH NODE GET DATA FROM THE SOURCE, STORES IT IN THE CHANNEL AND SENDS IT TO THE SINK; THE SINK OF ONE AGENT IS THEN THE SOURCE OF ANOTHER AGENT ON ANOTHER NODE
SOURCES AND SINKS CAN BE AVRO (WAY OF SERIALIZING DATA, APACHE PROJECT), AVRO USES JSON, SERIALIZES IN BINARY DATA FORMAT

TOPOLOGIES:
- MULTI-TIER: SINGLE AVRO SOURCE RECEIVES DATA FROM MULTIPLE SINKS
- REPLICATING: ONE SOURCE IS CONNECTED TO MULTIPLE CHANNELS
- MULTIPLEXING: ONE SOURCE IS CONNECTED TO MULTIPLE CHANNELS

FLUME HAS:
- CONFIGURATION COMPONENTS: DEFINED IN THE CONFIGURATION FILE; FOR EACH AGENT THIS CONSISTS OF SOURCES, SINKS AND CHANNELS; IF MULTIPLE AGENTS ARE OPERABLE ON THE SAME NODE, THE ALL SHARE ONE CONFIGURATION FILE (WHICH IS DECLARATIVE AND NOT PROCEDURAL); SOURCES CAN CONTINUOUSLY CREATE DATA, SINKS CAN BE LOGS
- INTERCEPTORS
- LINKAGE OF SOURCES AND SINKS
- FLUME AGENTS
