#CONTENT-BASED RECOMMENDATION IS BASED ON THE FEATURES OF YOUR PREFERENCES, WHEREAS COLLABERITIVE FILTERING IS BASED ON PREFERENCES OF YOUR PEERS/SIMILARITY OF OTHER UNKNOWN PRODUCTS (SIMILARITY BASED ON RATINGS, NOT CONTENT)
#THERE ARE TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS: MEMORY-BASED (WHOLE USER-ITEM-DATASET IS USED FOR BUILDING RECOMMENDATIONS) AND MODEL-BASED (A MODEL IS CREATED)

#FOR CONTENT BASED, THE INPUT USER RATINGS IS THE RATING THAT THE USER HAS GIVEN TO AN ITEM; ONE-HOT ENCODING IS OFTEN USED (MAKING SEVERAL CATEGORIES AND THEN ASSIGNING 0/1 FOR A CATEGORY); THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE INPUT USER RATINGS AND THE FEATURE-SET MATRIX, A WEIGHTED GENRE MATRIX IS MADE; IF THIS WEIGHTED GENRE MATRIX IS THEN SUMMED OVER DE COLUMNS (THUS THE TOTAL OF THE CATEGORIES IS RETRIEVED) AND THIS VECTOR IS THEN NORMALIZED, A PREFERENCE VECTOR IS CREATED; THIS PREFERENCE VECTOR TIMES THE FEATURE SET OF THE (TO BE RECOMMENDED) CANDIDATES, AND SUMMING THESE OVER THE ROWS, GIVES THE CANDIDATE WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE

#PROBLEMS WITH COLLABORATIVE FILTERING: DATA SPARSITY (SINCE USERS ONLY RATED 0.00001% OF THE PRODUCT BASE), COLD STARTS (FOR BOTH NEW USERS AND PRODUCTS) AND NON-SCALABILITY (WHEN NUMBER OF USERS OR ITEMS INCREASES, IT DOES NOT SCALE PROPERLY)
