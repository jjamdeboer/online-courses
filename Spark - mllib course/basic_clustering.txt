K-MEANS CLUSTERING AND GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING SUPPORTED BY MLLIB

K-MEANS CLUSTERING: PARALLEL, INPUT PARAMETERS (K, MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITERATIONS PER RUN [STOPPING PARAMETER], 'RUNS' DETERMINES HOW MANY TIMES THIS ALGORITHM IS RUN, INITIALIZATION DETERMINES HOW THE CENTROIDS ARE PLACED, ALSO OPTION OF RUNNING THIS ALGORITHM IN PARALLEL AND THEN NUMBER OF STEPS PER RUN CAN ALSO BE DETERMINED, EPSILON DETERMINES HOW SMALL THE TOTAL DISTANCE ALL CENTROIDS MOVE MUST BE FOR THE ALGORITHM TO STOP [STOPPING PARAMETER]), AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS (clusterCenters RETURNS CENTERS OF THE CLUSTERS IN COORDINATE AS NUMPY ARRAY, computeCost RETURNS SUM OF SQUARES DISTANCES TO CENTROIDS, k GIVES K, predict IS FUNCTION OF DATA POINTS AND RETURNS THE CLUSTER EACH POINT BELONGS TO)
IN MLLIB: K-MEANS++ -> K-MEANS|| (PARALLEL)

GAUSSIAN MIXTURE CLUSTERING: INPUT PARAMETERS (K, CONVERGENCE TOLERANCE GIVES TRESHOLD OF CHANGE IN LOG LIKELIHOOD AT WHICH ALGORITHM STOPS SIMILAR TO EPSILON [STOPPING PARAMETER], MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITERATIONS WAS ALREADY DEFINED, INITIALIZATION PARAMETER CAN ALSO BE CHOSEN AS WHERE TO LOCATE THE CENTROIDS), FUNCTIONS (gaussians HAS AS INPUT INTEGER SMALLER THAN K AND RETURNS PARAMETERS OF THAT GAUSSIAN, predictSoft GIVES THE PREDICTED MEMBERSHIP OF DATA POINTS TO WHICH CLUSTER THESE BELONG, weights RETURNS THE WEIGHT OF EACH GAUSSIAN IN THE MIXTURE, k GIVES K)
