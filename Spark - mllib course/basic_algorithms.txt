ALGORITHMS AVAILABLE:
- LINEAR REGRESSION: LINEAR RELATION BETWEEN INPUT AND OUTPUT, MAY BE MULTIDIMENSIONAL, EVALUATED USING MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR, MEANS SQUARE ERROR, ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR
- SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES: CLASSIFIER, CREATES HYPERPLANES TO SEPARATE DATA, BEST HYPERPLANE SELECTED BASED ON SUPPORT VECTORS
- LOGISTIC REGRESSION: PROBABILITY OF CHOOSING BETWEEN TWO CLASSES
- DECISION TREES: GREEDY CLASSIFIER/REGRESSOR, BINARY PARTITIONING THE FEATURE SPACE, MAXIMIZES INFORMATION GAIN WITH MINIMAL RUNTIME
- RANDOM FOREST: DATA IS SPLIT AND FED INTO SEPARATE DECISION TREES, WHEN DATA IS FED TO THE FOREST, EACH TREE WILL GIVE DIFFERENT OUTPUT AND THIS RESPONSE IS AVERAGED, MIGHT HAVE SMALLER TRAINING TIME THAN SINGLE TREE, SINCE IT IS PARALLELLIZABLE
- K-MEANS CLUSTERING: UNSUPERVISED, PUT K SEEDS/CENTROIDS AMONG DATA, SEED IS THEN MOVED TO GRAVITY-POINT OF ALL ITS NEARBY NEIGHBOURS, THIS IS REPEATED UNTIL SITUATION IS STABILIZED
- GAUSSIAN MIXTURE CLUSTERING: GENERALIZED FORM OF K-MEANS CLUSTERING WHERE BOUNDARIES ARE NOT 'HARD' BUT BASED ON GAUSSIANS
