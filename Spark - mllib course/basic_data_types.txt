SPARK'S MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY (MLLIB) SUPPORTS LOCAL MATRICES AS WELL AS DISTRIBUTED MATRICES ON MULTIPLE RESILIENT DISTRIBUTED DATASETS
DATA TYPES: LOCAL MATRICES AND LABELED POINTS; (UN)LABELED MATRICES
LABELED POINTS ARE LABELED MATRICES/VECTORS, USED FOR CLASSIFICATION, AMONGST OTHERS
(LOCAL) MATRICES CAN CONTAIN BOTH THE NUMBERS AND THE INDICES
DENSE ARRAYS CONTAIN ONLY THE NUMBERS (NUMPY/SCIPY ARRAYS, PYTHON LISTS), SPARSE ARRAYS (MLLIB SPARSEVECTORS, SCIPY CSC_MATRIX) ARE TWO PARALLEL ARRAYS THAT CONTAIN BOTH THE NUMBERS AND THE INDICES
FOR SPARSE DATA LIBRARY SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (LIBSVM) IS USED

ONE CAN USE ROW-MAJOR OR COLUMN-MAJOR FOR GENERATING A MATRIX, POINTER ARRAY GIVES THE START OF THE INDEX AND THE SIZE OF THE INDEX ARRAY
LOCAL MATRICES HAS DOUBLE DATA TYPE AND INTEGER INDICES
MLLIB SUPPORT BOTH ROW- AND COLUMN-MAJOR ORDERING, AND BOTH SPARSE AND DENSE MATRICES

DISTRIBUTED MATRICES:
- ROWMATRIX: WITHOUT MEANINGFUL ROW INDICES, EACH ROW IS LOCAL VECTOR, COLUMN LIMITED TO INTEGER RANGE (SINCE LOCAL VECTOR)
- INDEXEDROWMATRIX: MEANINGFUL INDICES, ROW REPRESENTED BY LOCAL VECTOR AND INDEX, CREATED FROM INDEXEDROWS OR TUPLE, CONVERTED TO ROWMATRIX BY DROPPING INDICES
- COORDINATEMATRIX: REPRESENTED BY TUPLE OF (X-COORDINATE, Y-COORDINATE, VALUE), SPARSE
- BLOCKMATRIX: MATRIXBLOCK CONSISTS OF TUPLES (ROW-INDEX WHERE BLOCK STARTS, COLUMN-INDEX WHERE BLOCK STARTS, MATRIX [MATRIX VALUES ARE SHOWN AS A ROW-BASED VECTOR]), CAN BOTH BE DENSE AND SPARSE, CREATED BY BLOCKMATRIX-FUNCTION WHICH CONTAINS MATRIXBLOCKS, HAS METHOD (.validate()) TO VALIDATE WHETHER THE SET-UP WAS CORRECTLY DONE
