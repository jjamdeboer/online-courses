DOCKER WAS RELEASED 2013, STARTED AS AN OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT OF DOTCLOUD, A COMPANY WHICH DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE
DOCKER WAS SUCH A SUCCESS THAT THE COMPANY DECIDED TO MOVE COMPLETELY TOWARDS DOCKER
DOCKER'S LOGO IS CALLED MOBY-DOCK; THEIR MASCOT IS A REAL-LIFE TURTLE CALLED GORDON

SIMILAR SHIFTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE BEEN: MAINFRAME TO PC'S (90'S); BAREMETAL TO VIRTUAL (HYPERWARE, VMWARE IN THE 00'S; TO FILL UP IDLE TIME IN SERVERS, DIVIDE IT UP INTO MULTIPLE PIECES OF SOFTWARE BY RUNNING VIRTUAL MACHINE ON IT); DATA CENTERS TO CLOUD-BASED SERVERS (10'S; STARTED BY AWS); HOST TO CONTAINERS (SERVERLESS AND FUNCTION-AS-A-SERVICE) CONTAINERS ARE THE NEW OBJECT OF COMPUTE
UNLIKE PREVIOUS SHIFTS, MIGRATING HAS BEEN THE MAIN FOCUS OF DOCKER, WHICH MAKES EXACTLY THIS EASIER ACHIEVABLE (BOTTLENECK OF PREVIOUS SHIFTS, WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON SYSADMINS, NOT DEVELOPERS)

DOCKER'S MAIN FOCUS IS SPEED: DEVELOP, BUILD, TEST, DEPLOY, UPDATE AND RECOVER FASTER
MATRIX FROM HELL IS THE TERMINOLOGY TO REFER TO ALL THE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE, DEPENDENCIES AND SURFACES THAT ARE NOWADAYS USED
~80% OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPER'S TIME IS SPENT ON MANAGING (LEGACY) SOFTWARE, JUST 20% ON INNOVATION
