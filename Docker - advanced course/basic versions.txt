THERE EXIST MULTIPLE EDITIONS OF DOCKER (MULTIPLE VERSIONS AND MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS)
NEXT TO THIS THERE EXISTS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPEN SOURCE/COMMUNITY EDITION/CE AND PAID/ENTERPRISE EDITION/EE
THE COMMUNITY EDITION RUNS ON MORE OPERATING SYSTEMS THAN THE ENTERPRISE EDITION
THERE ARE STABLE RELEASES (THOROUGHLY TESTED) AND EDGE RELEASES
DOCKER CHANGES QUICKLY, SO INSTALLATION CAN BE CUMBERSOME, DUE TO IT BEING AN EXTENDED PROJECT NOWADAYS

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF INSTALLATION: DIRECT, WINDOWS/MAC, CLOUD-BASED
THE DIRECT INSTALLATION IS INSTALLING IT DIRECTLY INTO THE OPERATING SYSTEM/KERNEL, WHICH UP TO 2016 WAS ONLY LINUX, BUT NOW ALSO RASPBERRY PI'S AND MAINFRAMES CAN DIRECTLY USE IT; ALSO WINDOWS 10 ENTERPRISE OR PRO CAN DIRECTLY INSTALL IT (DOCKER FOR WINDOWS)
THE WINDOWS/MAC-METHOD IS THAT A VIRTUAL MACHINE HAS TO BE STARTED TO RUN DOCKER, SINCE IT IS NOT NATIVELY SUPPORTED BY OTHER VERSIONS OF WINDOWS AND MACS
DOCKER CAN ALSO BE INSTALLED FOR REMOTE SERVERS, SUCH AS AWS/AZURE/GOOGLE CLOUD; THESE ARE COMPANY-SPECIFIC (SPECIAL DOCKER FOR AWS, FOR EXAMPLE)

ON DOCKER CONTAINERS CAN RUN TWO OPERATING SYSTEMS: LINUX AND WINDOWS
WHEN PEOPLE SIMPLY REFER TO 'CONTAINERS' THE DEFAULT IS LINUX, SINCE THAT IS WHAT WAS STANDARD FOR YEARS

ON LINUX, DOCKER RUNS NATIVELY AND CAN BE INSTALLED IN THREE WAYS: BY SCRIPT/BASH, BY STORE OR VIA THE DOCKER-MACHINE
DOCKER'S PHILOSOPHY IS THAT PAID OPERATING SYSTEMS GET THE PAID VERSION OF DOCKER, FREE OPERATING SYSTEMS ALSO GET ACCESS TO THE FREE VERSION
DOCKER USES SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE KERNEL, SO SOME VERY SPECIFIC LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS DO NOT COMBINE WELL WITH DOCKER
DO NOT USE PRE-INSTALLED SET-UPS FOR DOCKER, SINCE DOCKER IS SO QUICKLY CHANGING, THE NEWEST RELEASE IS RECOMMENDED (SO DON'T GO TO THE PACKAGE MANAGER TO INSTALL DOCKER)
