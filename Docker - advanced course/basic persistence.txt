CONTAINERS ARE IMMUTABLE (NOT CHANGING) AND EPHEMERAL (DISPOSABLE)
TRY TO AVOID CHANGING CONTAINERS, SIMPLY RERUN CONTAINERS AND CHANGE THE IMAGES WHENEVER POSSIBLE; TACTIC IS CALLED IMMUTABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
WISE IT IS THEREFORE TO SEPARATE STORED DATA AND RUNNING CONTAINERS, SO THAT NEW CONTAINERS CAN EASILY BE LAUNCHED; TACTIC IS CALLED SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHERE TO STORE DATA TO AND HOW TO STORE THAT DATA SUCH THAT IT IS PERMANENT/PERSISTENT (DOES NOT PERISH WHEN CONTAINERS ARE REMOVED)
TWO SOLUTIONS TO PERSISTENT DATA ARE DATA VOLUMES AND BIND MOUNTS
VOLUMES ARE SIMPLY AND OUTSIDE OF CONTAINER LOCATION TO STORE DATA (SUCH AS A SERVER WITH A DATABASE)
BIND MOUNTS ARE FILES THAT ARE BOTH ON THE HOST AND THE CONTAINER, SO THAT WHEN THE CONTAINER WRITES ON THIS FILE, THE FILE IS UPDATED AND THE FILE/DATA IS PRESERVED WHEN CONTAINER IS REMOVED

IN THE DOCKERFILE, VOLUMES CAN BE INTRODUCED BY THE VOLUME KEYWORD

TO GET INFORMATION ON VOLUMES: 'docker volume ls'
VOLUMES ARE SPECIFIED IN THE DOCKERFILE, BIND MOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE DOCKER RUN-COMMAND
