DOCKER HAS STANDARD SECURITY BY MEANS OF CONTROL GROUPS AND KERNEL NAMESPACES
LINUX NAMESPACES IS THE LIMITING OF SCOPE OF PROCESSES, THIS ENABLES THE EXISTENCE OF DOCKER AND CONTAINERS
CONTROL GROUPS IS THE LIMITING OF THE RESOURCES A NAMESPACE OR PROCESS CAN TAKE
CONTROL GROUPS ARE NOT A STANDARD FEATURE OF DOCKER AND CONTAINERS, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO IN PRODUCTION, PREVENTING SOME CONTAINERS TO TAKE UP LARGE AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES

CONTAINERS APPLY FOUR SECURITY FEATURES OUT OF THE BOX: APPARMOR, SECCOMP PROFILES, SE LINUX, LINUX KERNEL CAPABILITIES
DOCKER ALSO HAS A FREE CONFIGURATION CHECKER FOR HOST SYSTEMS: DOCKER BENCH; IT CHECKS THE FITNESS AND RELIABILITY OF HOST THAT HAS DOCKER INSTALLED; SCANSE WHETHER DOCKER HAS BEEN INSTALLED CORRECTLY WITH THE CORRECT PERMISSIONS

ALWAYS AVOID GIVING CONTAINERS ROOT PRIVILIGE; THIS IS AVOIDED AS A STANDARD IN APPLICATIONS (NGINX, HTTPD), BUT NOT AVOIDED IN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES (PYTHON OR NODE.JS CONTAINERS); THESE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CONTAINERS DO CREATE A USER GROUP, BUT NEVER SWITCH TO THAT GROUP, BUT THIS CAN EASILY BE FORCED IN A DOCKERFILE AND SHOULD BE DONE SO AS A STANDARD
ROOT HERE, IS ONLY ROOT IN THE CONTAINER, BUT MALICIOUS PARTIES MIGHT GET ROOT ACCESS OF THAT PARTICULAR CONTAINER, INFECTING A SYSTEM OR SWARM
AS AN EXTRA PRECAUTION: LINUX NAMESPACES CAN BE ENABLED ON TOP OF THAT, SO THAT WHEN THAT ROOT HACKER SOMEHOW MANAGES TO BREAK OUT OF A CONTAINER, THAT HACKER IS STILL TRAPPED WITHIN A NAMESPACE; IT GIVES THE DEFAULT THAT ALL CONTAINERS ARE RUN AS SUBPROCESSES THAT RUN AS A HIGH-NUMBERED USER RATHER THAN ROOT, WHICH IS THE STANDARD; THIS IS PER HOST, NOT PER CONTAINER

SCAN GIT/CODE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE FOR DEPENDENCIES AND VULERABILITIES (USING EITHER GITHUB OR SNYK)
IMAGES CAN ALSO BE SCANNED (TRIVY OR MICROSCANNER)
THERE ARE ALSO THIRD PARTIES (SUCH AS FALCO) THAT SCAN FOR SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOUR, SUCH AS COPYING SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM THE HOST ONTO A CONTAINER
THERE IS ALSO A DOCKER-SCANNER FOR THE WHOLE PIPELINE (FROM DEVELOPMENT TO DEPLOYMENT ON A SERVER) THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE AND PROCESSES WITH THE PROPER AUTHORITY CAN DO THE DESIGNATED THINGS
RELATED TO THIS ARE CODE SIGNING AND IMAGE SIGNING
