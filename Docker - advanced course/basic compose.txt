DOCKER COMPOSE IS A COMBINATION OF A COMMAND LINE TOOL AND A CONFIGURE FILE

RARELY SERVICES ARE STAND ALONE SERVICES, SO MULTIPLE CONTAINERS ARE DESIRABLE
DOCKER COMPOSE DEFINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MULTIPLE CONTAINERS, SAVES (MULTIPLE) DOCKER RUN COMMANDS AND SETTINGS IN AN EASY UNDERSTANDABLE FILE AND IS VERY EASY TO USE FROM THE COMMAND LINE
THE CONFIGURATION FILE IS WRITTEN IN YAML, WHICH IS AN EASY UNDERSTANDABLE CONFIGURATION LANGUAGE
FIRST LINE IN THE CONFIGURATION FILE IS THE VERSION OF YAML

DOCKER DOMPOSE IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION, BUT IT IS IDEAL FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO A SHELL SCRIPT THAT AUTOMATES THE BUILD

NOTICE THAT DOCKER COMPOSE AND DOCKER ARE SEPARATE ENTITIES, WHICH COME BUNDLES TOGETHER ON WINDOWS AND MAC, BUT NOT ON LINUX
FOR STARTING EVERY CONTAINER IN THE CONFIGURATION FILE: 'docker-compose up'
LIKEWISE, TO REMOVE ALL THE CONTAINERS AND NETWORKS: 'docker-compose down'

DOCKER COMPOSE CAN ALSO BUILD IMAGES DURING RUNTIME
IMAGES ARE BUILT DURING 'docker-compose up' WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN CACHE
BUILDING AN IMAGE CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH DOCKER COMPOSE, BUT IS NOT NECESSARY (NOTHING IS IN DOCKER COMPOSE, IT IS SIMPLY A TOOL TO HELP)
