DOCKER IMAGE IS TAR-FILE OF CONTAINER'S FILESYSTEM + METADATA
BLUEPRINT TO SHARE FOR OTHER USERS
PUSH/PULL IMAGES FROM CENTRAL REGISTRY
DEFAULT REGISTRY IS DOCKER HUB: FREE AND MANY IMAGES AVAILABLE
CAN CREATE PRIVATE REGISTRY BY SELF-HOSTING OR CLOUD PROVIDER; PRIVATE REGISTRY IS AVAILABLE AS DOCKER IMAGE

CREATING A DOCKER IMAGE IS WITH DOCKERFILE: SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING THE CONTAINER
THEN docker build -f DOCKERFILE WILL BUILD THE DOCKER IMAGE

DOCKER IMAGE LAYERS: CACHED, SO THAT EVERY LAYER IS BUILT ON TOP OF PREVIOUS LAYER
LAYERS ARE READ-ONLY; THIN READ/WRITE LAYER ON TOP OF THE READ-ONLY LAYERS MAKES UP A CONTAINER
THESE LAYERS MAKE REUSABILITY VERY EASY
UNION FILE SYSTEM: MERGE IMAGE LAYERS INTO SINGLE FILE FOR EACH CONTAINER
COPY-ON-WRITE: COPIES FILES THAT ARE EDITED ARE 'MOVED' UP TO WRITE LAYER, SO THAT LITERALLY ALL CONTAINERS CAN USE THE SAME IMAGE, ALTHOUGH SOME CHANGE SOME UNDERLYING LAYERS; SAVES TIME SINCE AL BASE LAYERS ARE CACHED; MORE CONTAINERS CAN BE PUT ON SAME HOST THIS WAY
