DOCKER HAS MANY ADVANTAGES, BUT DURING PRODUCTION/BUILDING/DEPLOYING:
- AUTOMATED SCHEDULING/SCALING
- SERVICE DISCOVERY
- ZERO DOWNTIME DESIRED
- HIGH AVAILABILITY AND FAULT TOLERANCE
- A/B DEPLOYMENTS

CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF WITH CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION: MANAGES CLUSTERS, SCHEDULES, SERVICE DISCOVERY, REPLICATION, MONITORING, DECLARED DESIREABLE STATE (ACTIVE RECONCILIATION)

IN TERMS OF LAYERS:
- PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (NODE)
- VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE (VIRTUAL MACHINE OR CLOUD SERVICE IF THERE IS ONE)
- OPERATING SYSTEM (UBUNTU, ...)
- CONTAINER ENGINE (DOCKER, ...)
- CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION (KUBERNETES, DOCKER SWARM, APACHE MESOS, ...)
- DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW OPINIONATED CONTAINERS (DEIS, ...)

SERVICE: MULTIPLE CONTAINERS DEPLOYED AMONG A CLUSTER
