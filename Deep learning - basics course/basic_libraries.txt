PLATFORMS (CAPABILITY/MODEL SELECTION, DATA MANIPULATION, USER INTERFACE, INFRASTRUCTURE); CAN BE FULL REMOTELY, OR PARTLY LOCAL:
- H2O.AI: MACHINE LEARNING PLATFORM WITH DEEP NETWORKS ADDED; OFFERS DATA PREPROCESSING; ONLY OFFERS MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON; BACKPROPAGATION WITH LBFGS; NEEDS TO BE DOWNLOADED; LOT OF FEATURES, DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
AMBATI, CANDEL, CLICK
- DATO GRAPHLAB: OFFERS CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK AND MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON; ALSO OFFERS MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS AND GRAPH ANALYTICS, WHICH IS UNIQUE FEATURE; INTUITIVE BOTH FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT; NEEDS TO BE DOWNLOADED; DOCUMENTATION IS LIMITED, ESPECIALLY ON THE API-FEATURE

LIBRARIES (FOR COMMERCIAL: DEEPLEARNING4J, TORCH, CAFFE; EDUCATIONAL: THEANO, DEEPMAT):
- THEANO: PYTHON; HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE, BUT NOT SO MUCH PREPROGRAMMED; BLOCKS PLATFORM; NO HADOOP SUPPORT
BENGIO
- LASAGNE: USED FOR CONSTRUCTING NETWORK LAYER-WISE
- KERAS: USED FOR CONSTRUCTING NETWORK LAYER-WISE
- PASSAGE: USED MAINLY FOR TEXT ANALYSIS
- CAFFE: C++ (PYTHON AND MATLAB INTERFACES AVAILABLE); MACHINE VISION AND FORECASTING; LAYER CONFIGURATION OPTIONS FOR CREATING OWN NETWORKS, OR USING UPLOADED NETWORKS FROM MODEL ZOO (EXAMPLES ARE ALEXNET AND GOOGLENET); BLOBS
JIA
- TENSORFLOW: C++; ; COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS; GOOGLE BRAIN PROJECT -> DISTBELIEF -> TENSORFLOW; COMPUTATIONAL GRAPH, LIKE THEANO; NODES REPRESENT DATA OR MATH OPERATION AND EDGES REPRESENT DATA FLOW (IN FORM OF TENSORS, THUS TENSORFLOW); SUPPORTS ALL COMPUTATIONS WHERE FLOW CAN BE REPRESENTED AS DATA FLOW GRAPH; MOOC ON UDACITY AND GOOD DOCUMENTATION; NO SUPPORT FOR HYPERPARAMETER CONFIGURATION; KERAS IS NEEDED FOR HYPERPARAMETER CONFIGURATION; DATA PARALLELLISM USING MAP AND REDUCE; MODEL PARALLELLISM ALSO SUPPORTED WHERE DIFFERENT PARTS OF MODEL ARE TRAINED ON DIFFERENT MACHINES; TENSORBOARD TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE

LIBRARIES - PLATFORMS: DIFFICULT - EASY, UNRESTRICTED - RESTRICTED, SLOW - FAST
