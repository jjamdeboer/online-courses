WAYS TO INSERT IN A FILE ARE 'i', 'a' (CLOSE TO CURSOR) OR 'I' (BEGINNING OF SENTENCE) OR 'A' (END OF THE SENTENCE) IN COMMAND MODE
ANOTHER WAY TO ENTER INSERT MODE IS 'o' (CREATING A LINE UNDERNEATH CURRENT LINE AND PUT IN INSERT MODE) OR 'O' (CREATING A LINE ABOVE CURRENT LINE AND PUT IN INSERT MODE)
ALSO FOR INSERTS, THE COUNT-OPERATOR HOLDS, SO WHEN '[NUMBER]' + 'i' IS TYPED, THE INSERTED TEXT WILL BE REPEATED A [NUMBER] TIMES
TO ENTER 'REPLACE' MODE, USE 'R', OR 'r' FOR SINGLE CHARACTERS, WHERE CHARACTERS ARE NOT NEWLY CREATED, BUT REPLACE EXISTING CHARACTERS
FOR DELETING (A WORD) AND ALSO ENTER INSERT MODE, USE 'c', SHORT FOR 'CHANGE', (FOR EXAMPLE 'c3W' OR 'c$') OR 'C' FOR DELETING EVERYTHING FROM THE CURSOR TO THE END OF THE LINE (EQUIVALENT TO 'c$')
FOR CHANGING OR DELETING A WHOLE LINE AT ONCE, USE 'cc'
TO ALTER THE CASE OF THE LETTER UNDER THE CURSOR, USE '~', TO CHANGE CASE OF LETTER UNDER THE MOTION, USE 'g~[MOTION]' (FOR EXAMPLE 'g~^' OR 'g~~' OR 'g~$')
FOR MAKING ALL THE LETTERS IN A MOTION UPPERCASE, USE 'gU[MOTION]' (FOR EXAMPLE 'gU3W' OR 'gUU') FOR LOWERCASE 'gu[MOTION]' (FOR EXAMPLE 'guu')
TO JOIN TWO LINES, USE 'J', WHICH APPENDS A SPACE AND THEN THE LINE UNDERNEATH THE CURRENT LINE TO THE CURRENT LINE; TO AVOID THE ADDITION OF SPACE, USE 'gJ', ALSO HERE THE COUNT-OPERATOR PATTERN HOLDS

TO SEARCH FOR THE NEXT SPECIFIC CHARACTER IN THE LINE, USE 'f[CHARACTER]' OR 't[CHARACTER]', 'F[CHARACTER]' AND 'T[CHARACTER]' FOR BACKWARDS SEARCHING
FOR SEARCHING IN THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, USE '/[CHARACTER OR WORD]' (FORWARD) OR '?[CHARACTER OR WORD]' (BACKWARD) AND TO REPEAT USE 'n' (FORWARD) OR 'N' (BACKWARD) FOR 'NEXT'
TO MOVE TO NEXT OCCURANCE OF THE WORD THE CURSOR IS ON, USE '*' (FORWARD) OR '#' (BACKWARD)
SEARCHING FOLLOWS THE COUNT-OPERATOR-COUNT-MOTION PATTERN (FOR EXAMPLE 'c3/[CHARACTER OR WORD]')

TO REPLACE THE FIRST OCCURANCE OF A WORD IN THE SENTENCE WITH ANOTHER WORD, USE 's/[CHARACTERS OR WORD TO BE REPLACED]/[NEW CHARACTERS OR WORDS]/' IN LINE MODE
TO REPEAT PREVIOUS COMMAND FOR THE WHOLE LINE, USE 's/[CHARACTERS OR WORD TO BE REPLACED]/[NEW CHARACTERS OR WORDS]/[FLAGS]' WHERE THE FLAG SHOULD BE 'g'
IN GENERAL, THE SUBSTITUTE COMMAND 's' CAN BE PRECEDED BY A RANGE, WHERE EVERY FIRST OCCURANCE IN EVERY LINE IN THE RANGE IS REPLACED, HERE '.' DENOTES CURRENT LINE AND '$' MEANS LAST LINE AND '%' MEANS ALL LINES (FOR EXAMPLE ':%s/IS/DURK/g' OR '1,15s/DURK/IS')
THE SEPARATOR '/' CAN BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER SYMBOL, SUCH AS '#', WHICH MAKES REPLACING PATHS IN FILES A BIT EASIER

TO CHECK WHETHER A SETTING IS ON, USE 'set' + '[SETTING]?' IN LINE MODE, TO TOGGLE USE 'set' + '[SETTING]!'

A GENERAL PATTERN IN VIM IS THAT A REPITION OF CHARACTERS MAKES THE COMMAND LINEWISE (FOR EXAMPLE, 'cc', 'dd', '~~', 'yy')

IN LINE MODE, THE ARROWS CAN BE USED TO RETRIEVE OLDER COMMANDS
