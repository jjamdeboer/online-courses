THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO ENTER VISUAL MODE: CHARACTERWISE 'v', LINEWISE 'V' OR BLOCKWISE 'ctrl' + 'v'
ALL THE HIGHLIGHTED TEXT WILL BE AFFECTED BY OPERATIONS LIKE YANK, DELETE, CHANGE, LOWERCASE, UPPERCASE, TOGGLE CASE, JOIN, APPEND
TO SELECT THE SAME TEXT THAT WAS SELECTED DURING LAST VISUAL MODE, USE 'gv'

TABSPACING IS 8 BY DEFAULT, SO IS THE SPACEWIDTH, BOTH CAN BE SET IN LINE MODE
TO CENTER USE 'center[NUMBER OF TOTAL CHARACTERS LINEWIDTH, 80 BY DEFAULT]' OR 'ce[NUMBER OF TOTAL CHARACTERS LINEWIDTH, 80 BY DEFAULT]', FLUSHLEFT 'left[NUMBER OF TOTAL CHARACTERS LINEWIDTH, 80 BY DEFAULT]' OR 'le[NUMBER OF TOTAL CHARACTERS LINEWIDTH, 80 BY DEFAULT]', FLUSHRIGHT 'right[NUMBER OF TOTAL CHARACTERS LINEWIDTH, 80 BY DEFAULT]' OR 'ri[NUMBER OF TOTAL CHARACTERS LINEWIDTH, 80 BY DEFAULT]'
