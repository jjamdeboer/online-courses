THE IN-MEMORY FILE REPRESENTATION IS CALLED A BUFFER IN VIM; IT'S A TEMPORARY STORAGE
ONLY WHEN CHANGES ARE SAVED, THE BUFFER OVERWRITES THE ORIGINAL FILE
OPENING MULTIPLE FILES WITH VIM IS ALLOWED, EITHER BY TYPING 'vim [FILE 1] [FILE 2] [ETC.]' IN THE TERMINAL OR BY USING 'edit [PATH TO ANOTHER FILE]' OR 'e [PATH TO ANOTHER FILE]' IN LINE MODE
THE SEE ALL OPEN BUFFERS, USE 'buffers' OR 'ls' IN LINE MODE
TO OPEN ANOTHER BUFFER, USE 'buffer [NUMBER OR FILE NAME]' OR 'b [NUMBER OR FILE NAME]' IN LINE MODE
WHEN 'ctrl' + 'd' IS USED AFTER 'buffer' IS TYPED, A LIST OF AVAILABLE BUFFERS APPEARS
TO INCREMENT THE CURRENT BUFFER (FOR EXAMPLE GOING FROM BUFFER NUMBER 1 TO BUFFER NUMBER 2), USE 'bnext' OR 'bn' IN LINE MODE; TO DECREMENT THE CURRENT BUFFER, USE 'bprevious' OR 'bp' IN LINE MODE
TO GO TO PREVIOUS BUFFER, USE 'ctrl' + '^' OR 'b#' IN LINE MODE
OPENING A BUFFER WITHOUT SWITCHING DIRECTLY TO IT, USE 'badd [PATH TO ANOTHER FILE]'
TO REMOVE ONE OF YOUR BUFFERS, USE 'bdelete [NUMBER OR FILE NAME]' OR 'bd [NUMBER OR FILE NAME]' IN LINE MODE

BUFFERS HAVE THREE STATES: ACTIVE ('a') WHERE THE BUFFER IS ON THE SCREEN AND IN LOADED IN MEMORY, HIDDEN ('h') WHERE THE BUFFER IS NOT ON SCREEN BUT IS LOADED INTO MEMORY (FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE THERE ARE UNSAVED CHANGES), INACTIVE ('i') WHERE THE BUFFER IS NOT ON THE SCREEN AND NOT IN MEMORY; INACTIVE IS DEFAULT AND NOT SHOWN

IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE OPENENED MULTIPLE BUFFERS OR THE SAME BUFFER IN MULTIPLE WINDOWS
A WINDOW IS A VIEW OF A BUFFER; TO CLOSE A WINDOW, THE USUAL 'q' OR 'quit' IN LINE MODE CAN BE USED
TO SPLIT THE WINDOW, USE 'sp' OR 'split' OR 'sp [PATH TO OTHER FILE]' OR 'split [PATH TO OTHER FILE]' OR 'vsplit' OR 'vs' OR 'vsplit [PATH TO OTHER FILE]' OR 'vs [PATH TO OTHER FILE]'; ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX FOR SPLITTING IS 'ctrl' + 'ws' OR 'ctrl' + 'wv', TO CYCLE THROUGH THOSE WINDOWS, USE 'ctrl' + 'ww'
TO QUIT ALL NON-ACTIVE WINDOWS, USE 'only' OR 'on' OR 'ctrl' + 'wo' IN LINE MODE
FOR SIZE ALTERATIONS, USE 'ctrl' + 'w' + '+'/'-'/'<'/'>'/'='/'|'/'_'
THERE IS A COMMAND FOR EXECUTING SOMETHING IN EVERY BUFFER, AND THERE IS A COMMAND FOR EXECUTING SOMETHING IN EVERY WINDOW, NAMELY: 'bufdo' AND 'windo' RESPECTIVELY

TO WRITE ALL CHANGES TO ALL BUFFERS (PRIMARILY HIDDEN), USE 'wall' OR 'wa'; TO ABANDON ALL CHANGES, USE 'qall' OR 'qa'

THE PIPE OPERATOR IN LINE MODE IN VIM IS A COMMAND SEPARATOR (FOR EXAMPLE 'bufdo s/</<</g | w')

IN THE GRAPHICAL VERSION OF VIM, GVIM, THE SYSTEM CLIPBOARD CAN BE ACCESSED USING '"+' (HANDY IF SOMETHING WAS COPIED OUTSIDE VIM); TO ACCESS THE CHARACTER OR CHARACTERS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED BY THE MOUSE (FOR EXAMPLE, OUTSIDE VIM), USE '"*'
