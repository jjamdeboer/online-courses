VIM IS AN ADVANCED TEXT EDITOR
VIM STANDS FOR VI + IMPROVED
VI STANDS FOR 'VISUAL' AND IS A VISUAL VERSION OF THE OLDER X-LINE EDITOR

THERE EXIST THE CONCEPT OF NODES IN VIM
WHEN VIM IS STARTED, ONE ENTERS IN NORMAL MODE/COMMAND MODE
VIM COMMANDS ARE CASE SENSITIVE
IN INSERT MODE, THE KEYSTROKES ARE INTERPRETED AS CONTENT OF THE FILE THAT IS EDITED, ENTER THIS MODE WITH 'i'
TO LEAVE A MODE, PRESS 'esc'
ANOTHER MODE IS LINE MODE OR COMMAND LINE MODE, WHICH CAN BE ENTERED WITH ':'
FOR EXITING VIM, USE THE LINE MODE AND 'q' FOLLOWED BY '!', TO SAVE THE CHANGES, ALSO INCLUDE 'w' FOR 'WRITE'
TO ENTER A FILE WITH VIM, USE 'vim [FILENAME]'; IF THE FILE DID NOT EXIST BEFORE, IT WILL BE CREATED IN MEMORY (YET, THROWN AWAY IF THE CONTENT IS NOT SAVED)
