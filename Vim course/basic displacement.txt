DELETE WITH 'd' OR 'x' IS ACTUALLY MOVING THIS TEXT TO THE UNKNOWN OR DEFAULT REGISTER
REGISTER IS A CLIPBOARD-LIKE PLACE IN MEMORY
TO PASTE THIS TEXT BACK TO WHERE THE CURSOR IS, USE 'p' OR 'P' SHORT FOR 'PUT', UNLESS NEW TEXT IS PUT TO REGISTER, THE SAME TEXT CAN BE PUT ANYWHERE MULTIPLE TIMES
OF COURSE, 'p' CAN BE ALSO BE CAST INTO COUNT-OPERATOR FORM
FOR SIMPLY COPYING, NOT CUTTING, USE 'y' IN LINE MODE FOR COPYING THE WHOLE LINE, OR COMMAND MODE 'yy' SHORT FOR 'YANK' 
COPYING WORDS CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH 'y' (FOR EXAMPLE 'y3B'), OF COURSE 'y0' OR 'y$' CAN BE USED AS WELL
ALSO HERE, COUNT-OPERATOR-COUNT-MOTION CAN BE APPLIED (FOR EXAMPLE '5yy' OR 'y$' OR 'y^' OR 'y3W')
FOR UNDOING ANY ACTION, USE 'u', FOR REPEAT 'ctrl' + 'r'

ALSO FOR DELETION HOLDS THAT THE COUNT-OPERATOR-COUNT-MOTION PATTERN CAN BE APPLIED (FOR EXAMPLE '5dd' OR '7dw' OR 'd7W')

THERE EXISTS SEVERAL REGISTER TYPES, THE MOST COMMON ONES BEING 'UNNAMED', 'NUMBERED' AND 'NAMED'
THE UNNAMED REGISTER CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH "", THE NUMBERED REGISTERS WITH "0, "1, ... UNTIL "9
THE UNNAMED REGISTER HOLDS THE CHARACTERS OF THE LAST 'd', 'c', 's', 'x' or 'y', THE "0 HOLDS THE LAST 'y' AND THE NUMBERS 1-9 HOLD MOST RECENT 'c' OR 'd'
TO VIEW WHAT IS IN THE REGISTER, USE 'reg' IN LINE MODE, ALSO 'reg' + '[SPECIFIC REGISTER NUMBER OR LETTER]' CAN BE USED
TO USE A SPECIFIC REGISTER, SAY FOR PASTING, ONE CAN PRECEDE THE COMMAND WITH "" OR "0
NAMED REGISTERS CAN BE INTRODUCED, BY USING "[LETTER], WHICH CAN BE HANDY OF MULTIPLE TIMES THE SAME THINGS MUST BE COPIED, WHILE DELETING AND COPYING OTHER THINGS IN BETWEEN AS WELL
TO REPLACE THE TEXT IN AN EXISTING REGISTER USE ITS SYMBOL (FOR EXAMPLE '"ad7W' AND THEN '"add'), TO APPEND SOMETHING TO AN EXISTING REGISTER, USE THE CAPITAL LETTER OF THE REGISTER (FOR EXAMPLE '"ad3W' AND THEN '"Ayy')
HERE, ALSO THE COUNT-REGISTER-COUNT-OPERATOR CAN BE APPLIED (FOR EXAMPLE '"a5p')
