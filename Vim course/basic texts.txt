THE PATTERN THAT CAN BE USED WITH DIFFERENT OPERATORS IS '[OPERATOR]a[OBJECT OR MOTION]' OR '[OPERATOR]i[OBJECT OR MOTION]' (FOR EXAMPLE 'daw' OR 'ciW') THE 'a' STANDS FOR 'AROUND' AND THE 'i' FOR 'INNER'
MOTIONS OR OBJECTS ARE 'WORDS' OR 'w' OR 'W', 'SENTENCES' OR 's', 'PARAGRAPHS' OR 'p'
TO ALTER CHARACTERS OR TEXT BETWEEN SPECIFIC CHARACTERS, USE 'ci[CHARACTER]' OR 'di[CHARACTER]', CHARACTERS CAN BE '[', ']', '(', '}', 't' FOR 'TAG', OR ' OR " OR `

COMPLEX REPEATS, OR MACROS, ARE A SERIES OF COMMANDS THAT CAN BE REPEATED
TO RECORD A SERIES OF COMMANDS, THE KEYSTROKES ARE SAVED INTO A REGISTER, TO DO THIS USE 'q[REGISTER]' AND THEN THE KEYSTROKES THAT NEED TO BE REPEATABLE
TO 'REPLAY' THE COMPLEX REPEATS, USE '@[REGISTER]'
TO 'REPLAY' THE MOST RECENT COMPLEX REPEAT, ALSO '@@' CAN BE USED

BEST PRACTICES FOR COMPLEX REPEATS ARE NORMALIZING THE CURSOR (FOR EXAMPLE, STARTING AT THE BEGINNING OR END OF A SENTENCE) BOTH AT THE END AND THE BEGINNING OF THE RECORDING
ALSO FOR COMPLEX REPEATS, THE COUNTER-OPERATOR PATTERN IS APPLICABLE (FOR EXAMPLE, '6@@' OR '3@b')
TO APPEND TO A REGISTER, USE THE CAPITAL LETTER OF THE REGISTER (FOR EXAMPLE, 'qB' AND THEN 'q')
TO CHANGE A SERIES OF COMPLEX REPEATS/REGISTER, USE '"[REGISTER]p' FOR PASTING, ALTER IT AND THEN '"[REGISTER]y' FOR PASTING IT BACK INTO THE REGISTER

TO DELETE UP TO A SPECIFIC CHARACTER, USE 'df[CHARACTER]', TO DELETE UP TO SPECIFIC WORD OR STRING OF CHARACTERS, USE 'd/[WORD OR STRING OF CHARACTERS]'
