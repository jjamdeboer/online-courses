TO GET HELP IN GENERAL, USE THE LINE MODE AND 'help' OR 'h', QUIT USING 'q' + 'enter'
FOR HELP ON A SPECIFIC COMMAND, USE LINE MODE AND 'help' + '[COMMAND]' OR 'h' + '[COMMAND]'
IN HELP, '^' IS SHORT FOR 'ctrl'

TO CYCLE THROUGH THE OPTIONS THAT MATCH THE (PARTLY) TYPED COMMAND ('h' + '[PARTLY TYPED COMMAND]'), USE 'tab'
THIS CAN BE USED WITH THE HELP COMMAND, BUT CAN BE USED GENERALLY IN COMMAND AND LINE MODE
