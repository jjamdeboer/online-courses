THERE EXIST THE CONCEPT OF NODES IN VIM
WHEN VIM IS STARTED, ONE ENTERS IN NORMAL MODE/COMMAND MODE
VIM COMMANDS ARE CASE SENSITIVE
IN INSERT MODE, THE KEYSTROKES ARE INTERPRETED AS CONTENT OF THE FILE THAT IS EDITED, ENTER THIS MODE WITH 'i'
TO LEAVE A MODE, PRESS 'esc'
ANOTHER MODE IS LINE MODE OR COMMAND LINE MODE, WHICH CAN BE ENTERED WITH ':'
FOR EXITING VIM, USE THE LINE MODE AND 'q' FOLLOWED BY '!', TO SAVE THE CHANGES, ALSO INCLUDE 'w' FOR 'WRITE'
TO ENTER A FILE WITH VIM, USE 'vim [FILENAME]'; IF THE FILE DID NOT EXIST BEFORE, IT WILL BE CREATED IN MEMORY (YET, THROWN AWAY IF THE CONTENT IS NOT SAVED)

FOR NAVIGATION IN COMMAND MODE, USE 'h', 'j', 'k' AND 'l'
FOR NAVIGATION THROUGH PAGES IN COMMAND MODE, USE 'ctrl' + 'f' FOR FOWARD AND 'ctrl' + 'b' FOR BACKWARD
NAVIGATING ONE WORD AT THE TIME, USE 'w' OR 'b', OR 'W' OR 'B' TO IGNORE ADJACENT WHITESPACES AND PUNCTUATION
NAVIGATING DOWNWORDS WHILE KEEPING THE CURSOR FIXED IS 'z' + 'enter'
EXITING FILE CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH 'z' + 'shift'
TO MOVE TO THE BEGINNING OF A LINE, USE '0'
A NUMBER OR ADJECTIVE CAN BE REPEATED MULTIPLE TIMES, AS CAN BE SEEN IN THE LOWER-RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN, FOR EXAMPLE '555555W', MOVES FORWARD 30 WORDS
FOR NAVIGATING TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SENTENCE, USE 'shift' + '^' AND '$' FOR THE END OF THE LINE
FOR NAVIGATION TO SPECIFIC LINE, USE '[NUMBER]' + 'gg' OR '[NUMBER]' + 'G', OR USE LINE MODE WITH SPECIFIC NUMBER
FOR NAVIGATION TO FIRST LINE OF THE FILE, USE 'gg', FOR LAST LINE 'G', OR LINE MODE WITH '$'

TO SEE STATUS OF THE FILE, USE 'ctrl' + 'g', IN LINE MODE, 'file' OR 'f'
TO SET AN OPTION, USE LINE COMMAND AND 'set' + '[OPTION NAME]'
TO UNSET AND OPTION, USE LINE COMMAND AND 'set' + 'no[OPTION NAME]'
EASIEST IS TO TOGGLE AN OPTION, WHICH IS DONE WITH 'set' + '[OPTION NAME]!'

USE 'x' FOR DELETION ON THE CURSOR AND 'X' FOR DELETION LEFT OF THE CURSOR
FOR DELETION OF A WORD (IGNORING INTERPUNTIONS AND WHITESPACE) 'dw', INCLUDING PUNCTUATION 'dW'
FOR DELETION, ALSO 'dh', 'dj' (DELETING CURRENT LINE AND LINE BELOW), 'dk' (DELETING CURRENT LINE AND LINE ABOVE), 'dl', 'd0' (DELETE UP TO FIRST POSITION IN THE SENTENCE), 'd$' OR 'D' (DELETES ALL CHARACTERS TO THE END OF THE LINE), 'dd' (DELETES CURRENT LINE), 'db', 'dB', ETC., CAN BE USED
PREVIOUS PATTERNS FOLLOWS OPERATOR-MOTION (DELETE OPERATOR AND WORD MOTION 'dw') 
PREVIOUS PATTERN CAN BE EXTENDED WITH COUNT-OPERATOR-MOTION NOTION ('5dw', DELETE 5 WORDS)
THIS, IN TURN, CAN ALSO BE EXTENDED WITH THE COUNT-OPERATOR-COUNT-MOTION NOTION ('d3w' DELETE 3 WORDS)

FOR REPITION OF LAST COMMAND/ACTION, USE '.'

THREE USES FOR '!': FORCE ACTION, SUCH AS QUITTING THE FILE, TOGGLE BETWEEN OPTIONS AND FOR EXECUTING EXTERNAL COMMANDS

THERE IS ALWAYS A CONNECTION BETWEEN LOWERCASE AND UPPERCASE COMMANDS IN VIM
