PREFERENCES ARE SAVED IN THE .vimrc ('RUN COMMANDS') FILE, LOCATED IN HOME (~)
THE .vimrc FILE PROBABLY DOES NOT EXIST YET AT THE BEGINNING, BUT CAN BE CREATED; TO SEE WHERE IT IS EXPECTED, USE 'version' IN LINE MODE
THERE IS A SYSTEM-WIDE .vimrc FILE, BUT MAKING CHANGES IN THE USER vimrc FILE IS RECOMMENDED
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION FOR EXECUTING COMMANDS IN A DIFFERENT FILE, NAMELY 'source [PATH TO FILE WITH COMMAND TO BE EXECUTED]' IN LINE MODE

IN GENERAL, A SETTING IS TURNED ON BY USING 'set [OPTION]' AND OFF BY 'set no[OPTION]' AND TOGGLED BY 'set [OPTION]!' ALL IN LINE MODE
TO CHECK WHETHER OPTION IS ON, USE 'set [OPTION]?' IN LINE MODE
TO SEE AVAILABLE OPTIONS, USE 'options' OR 'opt' IN LINE MODE
THE COMMANDS IN THE .vimrc FILE ARE EXECUTED AS IF THEY ARE TYPED IN LINE MODE (FOR EXAMPLE, 'set hlsearch' WILL BE EXECUTED AS IF ':set hlsearch')
COMMENTS ARE PRECEDED BY DOUBLE QUOTES (")

ANOTHER COMMAND NEXT TO SETTING AN OPTION, IS THE COLOR SCHEME, WHICH IS 'color [SCHEME]' IN LINE MODE
ANOTHER COMMAND NEXT TO SETTING AN OPTION OR A COLOR SCHEME, IS 'map' IN LINE MODE, WHICH MAPS KEYS TO COMMANDS (FOR EXAMPLE 'map * dd', OR 'map <F5> AMURKDURK<CR><ESC>')
IN ORDER TO NOT OVERWRITE KEYS, ONE COULD USE THE '<leader>' DESCRITPION BEFORE THE KEY WHICH IS MAPPED; FOR EXECUTION OF THIS COMMAND, THE LEADER KEY MUST FIRST BE INSERTED, WHICH IS '\' BY DEFAULT; TO SET A DIFFERENT LEADERKEY, USE 'let mapleader="[SYMBOL]"' (FOR EXAMPLE 'map <leader>p Gddggdd')
TO SEE ALL CURRENT MAPPINGS, USE 'map' IN LINE MODE

IN LINE MODE, THE UP AND DOWN ARROWS GIVE PREVIOUS COMMANDS; WHEN A PARTIAL COMMAND IS TYPED, THE ARROWS ONLY SCROLL THROUGH THOSE OPTIONS THAT MATCH YOUR TYPED PATTERN

FOR EDITING ANOTHER FILE THEN THE CURRENT FILE, USE 'edit [PATH TO OTHER FILE]' OR 'e [PATH TO OTHER FILE]' IN LINE MODE
