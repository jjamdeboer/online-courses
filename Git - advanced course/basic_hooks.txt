HOOKS ARE SCRIPTS (WRITTEN IN ANY LANGUAGE) THAT ARE EXECUTED BEFORE SOME GIT COMMANDS ARE EXECUTED. HOOKS ARE LOCATED IN THE HOOKS-SUBFOLDER WITHIN THE .git-FILE. ONLY WHEN THESE ARE EXITED AS 0, THE CORRESPONDING GIT COMMAND IS EXECUTED. GREAT FOR EXTRA CHECKS AND TESTS
WITHIN THIS FOLDER, .sample-FILES ARE LOCATED, WHICH DO NOTHING. TO MAKE A HOOK, CREATE A FILE WITH THE SAME NAME WITHOUT THE .sample-EXTENSION AND MAKE IT EXECUTABLE USING: chmod +x [NAME CREATED FILE]
TO WRITE THIS HOOK IN A CERTAIN LANGUAGE, ADD ON TOP OF THIS FILE: #!/usr/bin/env [ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS: bash, ruby, python]
