GIT FLOW IS BASED ON FIVE BRANCHES, OF WHICH TWO ARE CONSTANT AND THE OTHER THREE ARE CREATED AND DESTROYED WHEN NECESSARY:
- MASTER BRANCH, WHICH IS THE ONE THAT GOES INTO PRODUCTION
- DEVELOP BRANCH, WHICH IS THE ONE THAT HAS SOME EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES, MERGED WITH MASTER BRANCH WHEN TIME IS THERE
- FEATURE BRANCH(ES), WHICH IS WHERE NEW FEATURES ARE DEVELOPED, SHOULD ALWAYS BE CREATED FROM AND MERGED TO THE DEVELOP BRANCH
- RELEASE BRANCH(ES), WHICH IS WHERE NEW THINGS ARE DEVELOPED THAT SHOULD BE INTEGRATED IN THE NEW PRODUCTIONS, WHICH SHOULD ALWAYS BE CREATED FROM AND MERGED TO THE DEVELOP BRANCH
- HOTFIX BRANCH(ES), WHICH IS THE BRANCH WHERE THINGS ARE FIXED THAT ALREADY WENT INTO PRODUCTION, SHOULD ALWAYS BE CREATED FROM THE MASTER BRANCH AND ALWAYS MERGED INTO BOTH THE MASTER AND DEVELOP BRANCH
