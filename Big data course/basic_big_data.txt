BIG DATA IS RELATIVE TO THE SYSTEM ONE IS USING

VELOCITY (REAL-TIME STREAMING, CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGIES), VOLUME (HIGHER RESOLUTION SENSORS), VARIETY (SOCIAL MEDIA AND MOBILE AND WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES), VERACITY (COST AND TRACEABILITY) AND VALUE (THE 'V'S' OF BIG DATA)
RECOMENDATION ENGINES ARE APPLIED BIG DATA MACHINES
INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) IS NETWORK OF CONNECTED DEVICES WHICH ALSO CREATES A LOT OF DATA

8 bits = 1 byte
1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte
1024 kilobyte = 1 megabyte
1024 megabyte = 1 gigabyte (DVD)
1024 gigabyte = 1 terabyte
1024 terabyte = 1 petabyte
1024 petabyte = 1 exabyte (airports)
1024 exabyte = 1 zettabyte (world; mostly machines)

BIG DATA IS STRUCTURED (SQL), UNSTRUCTURED (80%, USUALLY TEXT) OR SEMI-STRUCTURED (XML, JSON)

BIG DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEMS: HADOOP, OOZIE, FLUME, HIVE, APACHE PIG, APACHE SPARK, MAPREDUCE AND YARN, ZOOKEEPER, TEXT ANALYTICS
UNSTRUCTURED: HADOOP, APACHE HBASE, NOSQL
HADOOP: OPEN-SOURCE AND FREE:
HADOOP FILE SYSTEM (HDFS), RESOURCE MANAGMENT, SCHEDULING, DISTRIBUTED PROGRAMMING INCLUDING MAPREDUCE AND YARN, COMMON SOFTWARE LIBRARIES
HADOOP USES GOOGLE'S MAPREDUCE AS FOUNDATION
NODE A COMPUTER, COLLECTION OF 30/40 NODES IN CLOSE VICINITY IS A RACK, HADOOP CLUSTER IS COLLECTION OF RACKS
HIGHLY SCALABLE, STORAGE PLATFORM

ENHANCED 360DEGREES VIEW IS BIG BROTHER DATA ON PERSONS; UNIFIED VIEW OF MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (CRM)

DATA LAKE TECHNOLOGIES: KEEPING DATA SOURCES IN ORIGINAL FORMAT, SUPPORTING ANALYSIS OF ORIGINALLY DISPARATE SOURCES
